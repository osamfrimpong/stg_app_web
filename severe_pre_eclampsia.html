<p><strong>SEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA AND IMMINENT ECLAMPSIA</strong></p>
<p>This is an obstetric emergency and must be treated urgently. Treatment is the same as that of eclampsia (see below). These cases are best managed in hospital under the supervision of an obstetrician. While blood pressure reduction is essential, lowering the blood pressure below 140/90mmHg may cause foetal distress and should be avoided. BP monitoring must be carried out every 15-30 minutes until the BP is reduced and the patient is stable. There after monitoring can be done by 2-4 hourly. Daily weighing of the patient is essential.</p>
<h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frontal headaches</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Visual disturbances such as double vision (diplopia), blurred vision, flashes of light</li>
<li>Epigastric pain</li>
<li>Decrease in urine production (oliguria)</li>
</ul>
<h3>SIGNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elevated blood pressure</li>
<li>Liver tenderness</li>
<li>Urine production of &lt; 30 ml/hour or &lt; 400 ml/24 hours</li>
<li>Increased tendon reflexes</li>
<li>Presence of ankle clonus (occasionally)</li>
</ul>
<h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC</li>
<li>Blood clotting profile (bedside clotting time, prothrombin time, INR, APTT)</li>
<li>Serum uric acid</li>
<li>BUE and Creatinine</li>
<li>Urinalysis and culture</li>
<li>Liver function tests</li>
<li>Random blood glucose</li>
<li>Daily assessment of urine proteins</li>
<li>Ultrasound scan for close foetal growth monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h3>TREATMENT</h3>
<p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To reduce the blood pressure, but not lower than 140/90 mmHg</li>
<li>To prevent the mother from suffering from complications of the</li>
</ul>
<p>hypertension such as a stroke</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent fits/eclampsia</li>
<li>To stabilise the patient and deliver her if eclampsia is imminent</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early delivery of mother if eclampsia is imminent</li>
<li>If the patient is not symptomatic and the pregnancy is less than 34 weeks allow pregnancy to continue if the foetal condition would allow</li>
<li>If the pregnancy is 34 weeks or more consider delivery after stabilisation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence Rating: [C]</p>
<h3>A. BP management in severe pre-eclampsia and imminent eclampsia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hydralazine, IV, 5-10 mg slowly over 20-30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nifedipine, sublingual, 10 mg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<ul>
<li>Labetalol, IV, 20 mg stat. over at least 1 minute. Repeat at 10-minute intervals if the BP remains &gt; 160/110 mm Hg as follows: 40 mg; 80 mg; 80 mg boluses to a cumulative dose of 220 mg When the BP &lt; 160/110 mmHg commence an infusion of 40 mg per hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Double the infusion rate at 30-minute intervals until satisfactory re- sponse or a dose of 160 mg per hour is attained.</p>
<h3>Then</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nifedipine retard, oral, 20-40 mg daily</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<p>Methyldopa, oral, 250-500 mg 8-12 hourly</p>
<h3>A. Management or prevention of seizures in severe pre-eclampsia</h3>
<p><strong>and imminent eclampsia</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium sulphate, IV, 20 ml of the 20% solution (4 g)</li>
</ul>
<h3>And</h3>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium sulphate, IM, 10 ml of the 50% solution, (5 g) into each buttock (total of 10 g)</li>
</ul>
<h3>REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3>
<p>Refer all cases of severe pre-eclampsia and imminent eclampsia promptly to a hospital or obstetrician after initiation of treatment.</p>
<p>When the "obstetrician" considers that the foetus is immature, the patient should be transferred to a hospital capable of looking after the immature baby.</p>
