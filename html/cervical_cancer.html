<body><p><span ><strong><u>CARCINOMA OF THE CERVIX</u></strong></span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span >Carcinoma of the cervix is the commonest form of female genital cancer seen in Ghana. While the disease is preventable, in Ghana, the absence of an effective screening system has resulted in most cases presenting late with advanced disease. In developed countries, the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen considerably due to regular screening procedures (e.g. Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid, Human Papilloma Virus [HPV] test).</span> <span >Vaccination against cancer-causing HPV infection is the ideal method for primary prevention of cervical cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer requires the services of a gynaecological oncologist and radiotherapist. Treatment includes surgery and/or radiation and/or chemotherapy. Surgery involves removal of the central tumour as well as the lymphatics draining the area (Wertheim's hysterectomy). This extensive surgery should be carried out only by trained specialists. Radiation treatment often involves localized pelvic irradiation.</span></p><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">CAUSES</h3><ul><li>Human papilloma virus (accounts for 80% of cases)</li><li>Associated risk factors include:</li><li>Sexual promiscuity</li><li>Multiple child births</li><li>Infections with Herpes Simplex Hominis type II, HIV</li><li>Smoking</li><li>Low socio-economic status</li><li>Family history</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">SYMPTOMS</h3><ul><li>Asymptomatic (diagnosed on routine cervical screening)</li><li>Symptomatic (advanced disease)</li><li>Abnormal vaginal bleeding</li><li>In between regular menstrual periods</li><li>After sexual intercourse</li><li>Post-menopausal bleeding</li><li>Abnormal vaginal discharge</li><li>Lower abdominal pain</li><li>Pain during sexual intercourse</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Urinary symptoms e.g. dysuria, frequency, incontinence</li><li>Rectal pain</li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;"><strong>SIGN</strong></p><ul><li>Early disease: Erosion of cervix or changes of chronic cervicitis</li><li>Late/advanced disease: Ulcerative or fungating cervical lesion on speculum examination</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">INVESTIGATIONS</h3><ul><li>Cervical biopsy</li><li>FBC and sickling status</li><li>Blood urea and electrolytes</li><li>Serum Creatinine</li><li>Serum uric acid</li><li>Chest X-ray</li><li>Ultrasound of Kidneys</li><li>CT Scan and or Magnetic Resonance Imaging(to detect aortic nodes and metastases to the lungs and liver)</li><li>Pelvic examination under anaesthesia</li><li>Cystoscopy and proctoscopy with or without biopsy to allow visualisation of vesical or rectal mucosa</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">TREATMENT</h3><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To treat central tumour</li><li>To treat areas of tumour spread with the aim of eradicating the disease</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">Non-pharmacological treatment</h3><ul><li>Surgery</li><li>Radiotherapy</li><li>A combination of surgery, and radiotherapy</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">Pharmacological treatment</h3><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Evidence Rating: [A]</span></p><ul><li>Adjuvant chemotherapy (See section on referral below)</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span >All patients must be referred to a specialist for evaluation to decide on stage of disease and best mode of treatment.
