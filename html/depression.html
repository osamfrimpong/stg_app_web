<body><p>Depression is a mood disorder, which may occur in all age groups, although the symptoms may differ in children. It is a relatively common condition and has a tendency to recur. Some affected persons may turn out to have bipolar disorder, in which case, episodes of mania occur.</p><p>Clinically significant depression, also called major depression, is twice as common in women as in men. Many affected individuals seek help from spiritual and traditional healers. For a good proportion of those who go to hospitals, their condition is not recognised.</p><p>Depression is a significant cause of morbidity all over the world and most people who attempt or successfully complete suicide have depression. One should not dismiss or take for granted statements made by patients such as "I want to die",  "life is not worth living", or "I am    fed up with life". All cases of attempted suicide should be referred to a psychiatrist after initial management of the presenting complication e.g. self-inflicted injuries or poisoning.</p><p>Recurrent depression or unipolar depression is treated differently (with antidepressants) from bipolar depression, which responds more to mood stabilizers.</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for major depression relies on the presence of at least five (5) of the symptoms listed in the section on symptoms below, experienced every day for at least two weeks.</p><p>In the treatment of depression, maximum tolerable doses of antidepressant medications must be given for at least 6 weeks before deciding a particular medication is not effective.</p><p>After an episode of depression, treatment must be continued for at least 6 months, as there is a high risk of relapse within this period.</p><p>Antidepressants must be stopped immediately if a manic swing occurs. Patients with suicidal tendencies must be admitted and kept under close observation.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Genetic</li><li>Familial</li><li>Environmental</li><li>Psychosocial factors</li><li>Endocrine disorders e.g. hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Depressed mood, often reported as feeling 'out of sorts'</li><li>Loss of interest or lack of pleasure in things previously of interest</li><li>Significant weight loss or weight gain</li><li>Insomnia or sleeping too much</li><li>Psychomotor agitation or retardation</li><li>Fatigue or loss of energy</li><li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</li><li>Impaired thinking</li><li>Poor concentration;</li><li>indecisiveness;</li><li>worrying excessively</li><li>Multiple bodily complaints</li><li>Suicidal ideas or thoughts of death</li><li>Hallucinations or delusions of morbid themes in severe cases</li></ul><p><strong>In children</strong></p><ul><li>Truancy or refusal to go to school</li><li>Poor school performance</li><li>Bedwetting in a previously 'dry' child</li><li>Odd behaviour, aggression or defiance</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Appetite changes</li><li>Some of the 'adult' symptoms listed above</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>Depressed mood</li><li>Evidence of weight loss or weight gain</li><li>Agitation or retardation</li><li>Hallucinations</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>FBC</li><li>BUE and Creatinine</li><li>FBS</li><li>Thyroid function and cortisol levels if indicated</li><li>Administer a standardized scale of depression such as the PHQ (patient health questionnaire 9 item scale)</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To reduce symptoms</li><li>To prevent disruption to normal life at home, work or school</li><li>To prevent suicide</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Counselling</li><li>Psychotherapy, specifically Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</li><li>Electroconvulsive therapy</li></ul><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment </strong>1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]</p><ul><li>Fluoxetine, oral,</li></ul><p><strong>ADULTS</strong></p><p>20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks,</p><p><strong>Then</strong></p><p>Increase if necessary to max. of 80 mg</p><p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p><p>8-18 years; 10 mg once daily for 1-2 weeks</p><p><strong>Then</strong></p><p>Increase if necessary to max. 20 mg once daily.</p><p>&lt; 8 years;  not recommended</p><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Note 10-4</td></tr><tr><td><p>Use with caution in children with epilepsy.
