<body><p>Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of frequent, loose, watery stools 3 or more times a day. Diarrhoea may be accompanied by vomiting.</p><p>In children, the commonest cause is viral. There is therefore usually no need to prescribe antibiotics. 0ther diseases like malaria, pneumonia, ear infections and urinary tract infections, may be associated with diarrhoea. Fluid loss occurs quickly in this age group because of their size. If not corrected, it may result in dehydration, which can be fatal.</p><p>A complaint of diarrhoea should be taken seriously. Always ask about the frequency and the texture of the stools. Giving antibiotics in all cases of diarrhoea may worsen or prolong the condition except in special circumstances (See section on 'Causes' below). Enemas and laxatives should not be given to patients with diarrhoea.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><p><strong>Acute diarrhoea (&lt; 2 weeks)</strong></p><p>•Infections</p><ul><li>Viral: e.g. rotavirus, norovirus</li><li>Bacterial: e.g. Salmonella spp., Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae</li><li>Protozoal: e.g. Entamoeba histolytica (amoebiasis)</li></ul><p>•Drug-induced: e.g. penicillins</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chronic diarrhoea (&gt; 2 weeks)</strong></p><p>•  Chronic infections: e.g. amoebiasis, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections with HIV</p><p>•  Functional: e.g. irritable bowel syndrome</p><p>•  Inflammatory: e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease</p><p>•  Malabsorption syndromes: e.g. chronic pancreatitis</p><p>•  Malignancy: e.g. colon cancer</p><p>•  Endocrine: e.g. hyperthyroidism, diabetic autonomic neuropathy</p><p>•  Drug-induced: e.g. laxatives, NSAIDs</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p>•  Frequent watery stools</p><p>•  Blood or mucus in the stool</p><p>•  Presence of fever</p><p>•  Reduced urine output</p><p>•  Associated vomiting</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p><strong>Adults</strong></p><p>•  Anaemia</p><p>•  Weight loss</p><p>•  Anorexia</p><p>•  Oral lesions e.g. oral ulcers, candidiasis</p><p>•  Skin lesions e.g. erythema nodosum</p><p>•  Signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, reduction in skin turgor, capillary refill &gt; 2 seconds, tachycardia, postural hypotension)</p><p>•  Enlarged thyroid</p><p>•  Abdominal masses</p><p>•  Rectal mass</p><p> </p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><p>•  FBC</p><p>•  Blood film for malaria parasites</p><p>•  Stool routine examination</p><p>•  Stool for culture and sensitivity</p><p>•  Blood urea and creatinine</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p>•  To prevent dehydration</p><p>•  To replace lost fluid</p><p>•  To maintain nutrition by ensuring adequate dietary intake during illness</p><p>•  To maintain personal hygiene</p><p>•  To eliminate infecting organisms where appropriate</p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>•  Keep surroundings clean</p><p>•  Improve personal hygiene e.g. hand washing after toilet</p><p>•  Adequate fluid intake - oral and intravenous as necessary (See section on 'Fluid management for children with diarrhoea')</p><p>•  Maintain adequate nutrition as can be tolerated</p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p><strong>A.

Refer all patients with chronic diarrhoea to a specialist for further evaluation and management.</p><p> </p><p><strong>TREATMENT ALGORITHM</strong></p><p><strong>Fluid management for children with diarrhoea</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment Plan A-Nodehydration</strong></p><p>•  Child can be treated safely at home</p><p>•  Instruct mother to give home-based fluids like rice water, koko, soup, water, and 0ral Rehydration Salt (ORS).</p><p>•  Breastfed babies should be given breast milk and ORS</p><p>•  Give as much as child wants of all the fluids</p><p>•  Child should continue to feed</p><p>•  Ask the mother to return to the health facility if the child gets worse, passes more watery stools, vomits repeatedly, becomes very thirsty, eats or drinks poorly or is not better in 2 days</p><p>•  Instruct mother on how to prevent diarrhoea</p><p>ORS currently recommended for use in mild to moderate diarrhoea has a reduced sodium and glucose concentration (low osmolarity).</p><p><strong>How to prepare ORS</strong></p><p>ORS: Dissolve the contents of one sachet of ORS in 600 ml or 1000 mls depending on type of ORS.</p><p>•  To get 600 ml, use 2 small (300 ml) soft drink bottles or 1 big beer bottle</p><p>•  To get 1000 ml, use 1L mineral water bottle</p><p>The child or adult should drink AS MUCH of it as he/she wants. If the child vomits, the mother should wait about 10 minutes and give it again.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Treatment Plan B-mild to moderate dehydration</strong></p><p><strong>For the child with mild-moderate dehydration, use treatment Plan B</strong></p><p>•  Child to be treated in the health facility</p><p>•  Give ORS over the first 4 hours as shown in the Table for Plan B</p><p>•  If child vomits, wait 10 minutes and start again</p><p>•  Continue with other fluids the child will accept</p><p>•  Instruct mother to continue breast feeding if child is breastfeeding</p><p>•  Observe stools passed and record quantity</p><p>•  Check for signs of worsening dehydration</p><p>•  If eyes become puffy, it means too much fluid has been given so stop ORS and re-evaluate</p><p>•  Reassess state of dehydration after 4 hours</p><p>•  If clinical state has improved with no dehydration - go to plan A</p><p>•  If there is still mild-moderate dehydration repeat plan B</p><p>•  If condition is worsening - go to plan C</p><p> </p><p>*Use the child's age only when you do not know the weight. The approximate amount of ORS required (in ml) can also be calculated by multiplying the child's weight (in kg) by 75</p><p><strong>Treatment Plan C-Severe dehydration</strong></p><p>•  A child with severe dehydration requires urgent treatment with IV fluids in hospital</p><p>•  If the child can drink, give ORS by mouth while the IV line is being</p><p>set up</p><p>•  Start IV fluids immediately. Give 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate solution or, if not available, normal saline or cholera replacement fluid (5:4:1), divided as shown in the Table for Plan C below:</p><p>•  If you cannot give the above treatment and cannot pass a nasogastric tube, refer to a health facility that can do so.</p><p>•  Reassess the child every 1-2 hours. If hydration status is not improving, give the IV fluid more rapidly than as stated in the Table for Plan B</p><p>•  Also give ORS (about 5 ml/kg body weight/hour) as soon as the child can drink: usually after 3-4 hours (infants) or 1-2 hours (children)</p><p>•  Reassess an infant after 6 hours and a child after 3 hours. Classify dehydration. Then choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C) to continue treatment</p><p>•  Assess child hourly. If not improving or dehydration is worse, increase</p><p>drip rate</p><p>•  Do not stop the IV fluids until the child has been observed to retain the ORS for at least 1 hour and there is improvement in the clinical condition</p><p>•  Continue ORS on treatment plan B and continue to observe child until child has no signs of dehydration, then move to Plan A</p><p>•  Severe diarrhoea may be complicated by marked fluid loss accompanied by loss of potassium (hypokalaemia) or on the other hand, impaired renal function leading to acidosis and elevated blood potassium (hyperkalaemia)</p><p>•  When the patient is passing adequate amounts of urine, probably indicating good renal function, start potassium containing foods such as coconut water and fresh fruits (e.g. banana)</p><p>•  If there is clinical and/or laboratory evidence of severe hypokalaemia, potassium should be given by the intravenous route using potassium chloride but only in a hospital. Potassium containing fluids such as half strength Darrow's solution or Ringer's lactate may be added</p><p>•  If possible, infants and children should continue to breastfeed or eat during the period of diarrhoea.</p><p> </p><p>*Repeat once if radial pulse is still very weak or not detectable.</p>
