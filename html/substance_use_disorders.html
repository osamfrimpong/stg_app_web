<body><p>Abuse of substances such as marijuana, benzodiazepines, heroine, cocaine etc. is prevalent in many communities around the country. Typically, individuals with such disorders request help only after they are forced to do so by family members. They may also begin to have withdrawal symptoms when on admission for serious physical illness. This is because they have no access to the substance being abused. This may complicate treatment of the primary disease for which they were admitted.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Social factors</li><li>Peer pressure (e.g. family members, friends)</li><li>Lack of coping skills (e.g. with life's difficulties, aids to coping in times of trouble)</li><li>Addiction</li><li>Tolerance (increased requirement of substance to maintain the same feeling)</li><li>Withdrawal effects (unpleasant effects lead to a return to drug use)</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p><strong>Cannabis withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Insomnia</li><li>Shakiness</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Restlessness</li><li>Anxiety</li><li>Anger</li><li>Onset: Within 24 hours of drug use</li><li>Duration: 1-2 weeks</li></ul><p><strong>Benzodiazepine withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Anxiety</li><li>Headache</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Muscle aching and twitching</li><li>Perceptual changes</li><li>Feelings of unreality</li><li>Depersonalization</li><li>Seizures</li><li>Onset: 1-10 days (depending on half-life of drug)</li><li>Duration: 3-6 weeks (may be longer)</li></ul><p><strong>Opioid withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Anxiety</li><li>Craving</li><li>Muscle tension</li><li>Muscle and bone ache</li><li>Muscle cramps and sustained contractions</li><li>Sleep disturbance</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Hot and cold flushes</li><li>Piloerection</li><li>Yawning</li><li>Lacrimation and rhinorrhoea</li><li>Abdominal cramps</li><li>Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea</li><li>Palpitations</li><li>Elevated pulse and blood pressure</li><li>Dilated pupils</li><li>Onset: 6-24 hours (may be later with longer-acting opioids)</li><li>Duration: peaks 2-4 days, ceases 5-10 days (more prolonged for longer-acting opioids)</li></ul><p><strong>Psychostimulant withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Crash (fatigue, flat affect, increased sleep, reduced cravings)</li><li>Withdrawal (fluctuating mood and energy levels, cravings, disturbed sleep, poor concentration)</li><li>Extinction (persistence of withdrawal features, gradually subsiding)</li><li>Onset: 6-12 hours (cocaine); 12-24 hours (amphetamines)</li><li>Duration: Several weeks for withdrawal phase, then months for extinction</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p><strong>Cannabis withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Same as symptoms</li></ul><p><strong>Benzodiazepine withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Same as symptoms</li></ul><p><strong>Opioid withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Same as symptoms</li></ul><p><strong>Psychostimulant withdrawal</strong></p><ul><li>Same as symptoms</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Toxicology screen for suspected substances</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Box 10-2: Screening of patients suspected of substance abuse</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Physical appearance</p><ul><li>Sweating, tremor, agitation, problem with coordination, gait.
