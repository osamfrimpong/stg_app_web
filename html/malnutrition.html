Adding a Document Viewer with PDFTron
Conclusion
When Google first released their mysterious Fuchsia OS in 2016, it was claimed that it could run on virtually anything -- from a smartwatch to your car’s dashboard entertainment system -- setting the stage for complete integration of Google products into any home IoT environment.

Fast forward a couple years and Fuchsia hasn’t yet achieved ubiquity among smart devices. But Flutter, Fuchsia’s open source mobile app SDK, has certainly gained popularity as a way to build iOS and Android apps that look the same. Now Google claims thousands of apps on the Google Play and Apple App stores have been built using Flutter. And it’s not hard to see why developers prefer Flutter. Its well-written documentation, near-native rendering performance via the Skia 2D engine, and support for hot reload make building cross-platform delightful.

Since PDFTron’s SDKs are cross-platform, we knew we had to release Flutter support. In this blog, we’ll walk you through how to add a PDF and MS Office document viewer to a Flutter app via the PDFTron SDK. All of the code is available on our Github here.
