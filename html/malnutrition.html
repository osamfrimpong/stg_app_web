    <title>Malnutrition</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Malnutrition occurs when there is a deficiency in intake of essential nutrients (i.e. proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals). It is most commonly seen in children less than five years, particularly after weaning. Malnutrition reduces the individual's ability to fight disease and infection thereby increasing the likelihood of the patient presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, worm infestation, pneumonia, tuberculosis, otitis media, urinary tract infection etc. In adults, malnutrition frequently occurs in association with chronic alcoholism.</p>
  
  <p>Protein energy malnutrition (PEM), when severe, presents in different forms such as marasmus, kwashiorkor or marasmic-kwashiokor. </p>
  
  <p>Birth-spacing, through family planning, as well as exclusive breast- feeding for up to 6 months, followed by Introduction of a weaning diet at 6 months and continuation with complimentary foods for up to 2 years, may be helpful measures in preventing malnutrition in young children. </p><p>Encouraging a balanced diet for the family, including pregnant and lactating women, and nutrition education in schools and villages may help reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in the community.</p>
