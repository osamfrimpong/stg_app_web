<body><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Neonates, pre-pubertal and pubertal children are also at risk of contracting STIs. The modes of transmission in these children are mostly through maternal infections, sexual abuse or exploitation and voluntary sexual activity in older children. The STls in this age group include neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum), and other STI-related syndromes similar to that in adults.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Some of these STls (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia), if acquired after the neonatal period, are indicative of sexual contact. For other STls, (e.g. HPV infections and vaginitis), the association with sexual contact is not clear.</span></p>
