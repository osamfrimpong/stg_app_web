<body><p>Pregnancy makes women more likely to get malaria or die from malaria. Malaria infection is more severe during pregnancy while pregnancy and its outcomes can become complicated by it. The effects of malaria on the pregnant mother include a severe form of the illness, anaemia, miscarriage, pre-term labour, and post-partum haemorrhage. Risks to the foetus include foetal anaemia, pre-maturity, intra-uterine growth restriction, low birth weight, stillbirth, congenital malaria, and increased perinatal mortality. Preventive measures must be emphasised (i.e. Insecticide-treated Nets [ITNs] and Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy [IPTp] under direct observation) while confirmed cases must be treated promptly.</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p>Treatment objectives</p><ul><li>To ensure prompt and effective case management</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>None</li></ul><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p><strong>A.

Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp)</strong></p><p>IPTp consists of giving the fixed-dose combination medication Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) in treatment doses at predefined intervals after quickening (16 gestational weeks). Current recommendation is that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) be given to all pregnant women at each scheduled antenatal care visit except during the first trimester. WH0 recommends a schedule of four focused antenatal care visits for normal pregnancy. In Ghana, the national malaria control strategy reserves SP for the purpose of intermittent preventive treatment only.</p><p>To prevent the development of drug resistance, SP is not to be used for other purposes such as treatment of acute attacks of malaria.</p><ul><li>Sulphadoxine (500 mg)-Pyrimethamine (25 mg), oral,</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Note 18-16</td></tr><tr><td>Co-administered as Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) during antenatal visits on at least 3 occasions and at most on 7 occasions.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p>
