<body><p>Insomnia is defined as a subjective report of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep, and that results in some form of daytime impairment. Insomnia symptoms occur quite commonly in the general population. Risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, co-morbid disorders such as medical, psychiatric, substance use, and shift work. Patients with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders have relatively high rates of insomnia.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Behavioural - spending more time in bed in an effort to "catch up" on sleep</li><li>Stress</li><li>Learned habits which do not enhance sleep</li><li>Cognitive distortions (e.g. if one does not sleep throughout the night, one has not slept at all)</li><li>Medicines (e.g.for treatment of common cold, hypertension, asthma)</li><li>Caffeine-containing beverages (e.g. coffee, tea)</li><li>Withdrawal from alcohol and other drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines)</li><li>Medical condition (e.g. sleep apnea, airway obstruction, liver disease, renal disease, thyroid disorders)</li><li>Psychological and environmental factors</li><li>Other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and mood disorders</li><li>Travel (especially across time zones leading to jet lag)</li><li>Shift work</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Prolonged average time for falling asleep - longer than 30 minutes</li><li>Total sleep time less than 6.5 hours</li><li>Difficulty falling asleep</li><li>Frequent awakenings</li><li>Difficulty returning to sleep</li><li>Awakening too early in the morning</li><li>Sleep that does not feel restful, refreshing or restorative</li><li>Anticipating poor sleep hours before bedtime, and becoming more alert and anxious as bedtime approaches</li><li>Daytime effects of poor sleep:</li><li>Fatigue and sleepiness</li><li>Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties</li><li>Poor quality of life (worsened by interpersonal difficulties, or avoidance of day activities)</li><li>Exacerbation of co-morbid conditions such as depression, high blood pressure, etc.</li><li>Day-to-day variability</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Box 10-1: History taking and assessment of patients with Insomnia</strong></td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Characterization of the sleeping environment (couch/bed, light/dark, qui- et/noisy, room temperature, alone/bed partner, TV on/off), patient's state of mind (sleepy vs. wide awake, relaxed vs. anxious)</li><li>Identify perpetuating negative behaviours and cognitive processes</li><li>Assess Sleep-Wake Schedule with sleep dairy: time to fall asleep (sleep latency), number of awakenings, Wake time After Sleep Onset (WASO), sleep duration</li><li>Assess</li><li>Breathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing)</li><li>Sleep related movement disorders (kicking, restlessness)</li><li>Parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization)</li><li>Co-morbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches)</li><li>0ther physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxiety, frustration, sadness)</li></ul><p>Assess Daytime Activities and Daytime Function:</p><ul><li>Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary)</li><li>Work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities)</li><li>Lifestyle (sedentary/active, homebound, light exposure, exercise)</li><li>Travel (especially across time zones)</li><li>Quality of life and exacerbation of co-morbid disorders</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>FBC</li><li>BUE and creatinine</li><li>LFTs</li><li>Blood glucose</li><li>Thyroid function tests</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>Reduction of waking symptoms</li><li>Improvement of daytime function</li><li>Reduction of distress</li><li>Treatment of co-morbid conditions</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Stimulus control therapy (avoid stimulating sleep environments such as leaving lights, TV and radio on)</li><li>Relaxation training</li><li>Cognitive Behavior Therapy</li><li>Avoidance of day-time sleep</li><li>Avoidance of excessive stimulant consumption pre-bed time (e.g.coffee, tea, alcohol etc.)</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment </strong>1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [C]</p><ul><li>Lorazepam, oral,</li></ul><p><strong>ADULTS</strong></p><p>1-4 mg at bedtime</p><p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p><p>Not recommended</p><p><strong>Or</strong></p><ul><li>Triazolam, oral,</li></ul><p><strong>ADULTS</strong></p><p>Elderly;
