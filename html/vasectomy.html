It is carried out by trained surgeons usually under local anaesthesia after careful counselling and informed&nbsp;consent.</span> <span style="color:#231F20;">Vasectomy is the most effective male family planning method. Involving males in issues of reproductive health and family planning has several benefits with a positive impact on society.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">Vasectomy should be encouraged for appropriate clients. It is less invasive and simpler than female sterilisation. Reversal of vasectomy is a difficult surgery using loupes/microscope with success rate of 60-80% if done in less than 3 years after vasectomy.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span style="color:#231F20;">Clients should be referred to a Family Planning Unit or Urologist for the procedure.</span></p>
