<body><p><strong>Pertussis</strong></p><p>This is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory tract infection common in children and adults. The incubation period is 7-21 days.</p><p>Complications include subconjunctival haemorrhage, otitis media, apnoea, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, activation of latent tuberculosis, dehydration, fever, convulsions, rectal prolapse, and malnutrition. Admit to hospital when complications are present.</p><p>Pertussis can be prevented by the "five-in-one" Immunisation recommended for all children (See section on 'Immunisation').</p><p>In the event of a child developing pertussis before immunisation, the "five in one" vaccine should still be given to protect against the four other diseases.</p><p>During epidemics, or when there is a clear history of contact in a child with catarrh, appropriate antibiotics may help reduce the period of infectivity and transmission. All cases should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer.</p><p><strong>CAUSE</strong></p><p> • Bordetella pertussis</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p><strong>Catarrhal Phase: Initial 1-2 weeks</strong></p><p> • Low grade fever</p><p> • Nasal discharge</p><p> • Mild cough</p><p><strong>Paroxysmal phase: within the following 6-10 weeks</strong></p><p> • Episodes of violent repetitive cough ending with inspiratory whoop or vomiting (whoop may be absent in babies and adults)</p><p><strong>Recovery (convalescent) phase: next 2-3 weeks</strong></p><p> • Gradual reduction in bouts of coughing</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p> • Apnoea (long pause in breathing) common in babies</p><p> • Cyanosis</p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><p> • FBC - high total lymphocyte count</p><p> • Chest X-ray (to exclude other causes of chronic cough)</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p> • To reduce transmission</p><p> • To prevent complications</p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p> • Feed frequently between coughing spasms</p><p> • Encourage adequate oral fluid intake</p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p><strong>A.
