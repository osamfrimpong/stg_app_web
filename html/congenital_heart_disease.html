<body><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Congenital malformation of the heart, commonly referred to as "Hole-in-Heart", is quite a common malformation with an incidence of   8 out of 1000 live births. There are two main groups of congenital heart disease namely, acyanotic and cyanotic. The acyanotic types include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus  as well as aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of the aorta. The cyanotic types are associated with a mixing of deoxygenated blood with oxygenated blood and include Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA).</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Early recognition of the specific type and appropriate medical or surgical intervention is important in improving the quality of life and reducing morbidity from complications.</span></p><h3>CAUSES</h3><p> • Idiopathic</p><p> • Genetic (higher risk with increasing maternal age)</p><p>•      Maternal infections due to viruses in early pregnancy, notably rubella</p><p> • Maternal diabetes</p><p> • Alcohol, smoking , and use of drugs during early pregnancy</p><p> • Exposure to X-rays and other radiation during early pregnancy</p><p> • Prematurity</p><p> • Multiple pregnancy</p><h3>SYMPTOMS</h3><p><strong>Acyanotic</strong></p><p> • Easy fatiguability</p><p> • Breathlessness</p><p> • Poor feeding/Interruption of sucking in babies during feeding</p><p> • Poor growth</p><p> • Cold sweat on forehead</p><p> • Puffy eyelids, swollen feet (however, these are uncommon in infants)</p><p> • Distended abdomen</p><p> • Exertion may lead to chest pains, syncope or sudden death</p><h3>Cyanotic</h3><p> • All symptoms of acyanotic heart disease, plus the following:</p><p> • Blue tongue and fingernails (cyanosis) at birth or becoming worse with exertion in older children</p><p> • Squatting several times during play in toddlers</p><h3>SIGNS</h3><p><span ><strong>Acyanotic</strong></span></p><p> • Signs of heart failure for moderate to severe lesions:</p><p>•  Cold sweaty skin</p><p>•  Puffy eyelids</p><p>•  Distended neck veins and ankle oedema (in older children)</p><p>•  Tachycardia</p><p>•  Tachypnoea</p><p>•  Weak thready pulse</p><p>•  Cardiomegaly</p><p>•  Gallop rhythm</p><p>•  Crepitations, rhonchi</p><p>•  Hepatomegaly</p><p> • Heart murmur (not always present)</p><p><span ><strong>Cyanotic</strong></span></p><p> • Signs of heart failure as above, plus</p><p> • Finger clubbing</p><p> • Cyanosis (low peripheral oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry)</p><p> • Heart murmur</p><p> • Hypercyanotic attack i.e. respiratory distress with deepening cyanosis, loss of consciousness and convulsions</p><p> </p><h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3><p> • FBC</p><p> • Chest X-ray</p><p> • ECG</p><p> • Echocardiography</p><h3>TREATMENT</h3><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p> • Early recognition of the problem</p><p> • Prompt treatment of heart failure</p><p> • Early surgical correction if indicated</p><p> • Prevention of endocarditis</p><h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3><p> • Ensure good nutrition, good oral and dental hygiene</p><p> • Avoid excessive physical exertion (notify parents and teachers)</p><h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3><p><span ><strong>A.
