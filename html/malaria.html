<p>Malaria is a very common infection in Ghana. It follows the introduction of protozoan malaria parasites into the bloodstream by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Malaria is a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality especially among vulnerable individuals, such as children under 5 years of age, pregnant women (sometimes with adverse foetal and maternal outcomes), patients with sickle cell disease and visiting non-resident Ghanaians and expatriates.</p><p>Based on the clinical severity, cases of malaria are categorized as either 'uncomplicated' or 'severe'. A diagnosis of malaria can be suspected based on the patient's symptoms and the physical findings at examination. However, for a definitive diagnosis to be made laboratory tests (blood film and/or Rapid Diagnostic Test) must demonstrate the malaria parasites or their components since the clinical presentation of the condition can be similar to other common diseases such as typhoid fever, urinary tract infection, septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis in both adults and children and measles, otitis media, tonsillitis, etc. in children.</p><p>In Ghana, diagnosis is progressively being shifted from clinical to laboratory confirmation as the basis for treatment. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) may be used to confirm a diagnosis if microscopy (blood film) is not available.</p><p>Preventive measures in the community mainly target elimination&nbsp; of the insect vector or prevention of mosquito bites while additional chemoprophylaxis is required for vulnerable individuals.</p><p>The development of resistance of malaria parasites to anti-malarial medications is a matter of major public health concern. This phenomenon is largely the result of 'over-diagnosis' and wrong diagnosis of malaria&nbsp; &nbsp;by healthcare practitioners and patients alike, with its attendant over- treatment and sometimes partial or incomplete treatment, leading to over-exposure of the parasites to the anti-malarial drug (drug pressure). Additionally, Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT), rather than monotherapy with artemisinin derivatives, is currently recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria to prevent the development of drug resistance.</p><p>It&nbsp; is&nbsp;therefore&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp;obtain&nbsp; laboratory&nbsp; confirmation&nbsp;of&nbsp; &nbsp;a diagnosis of malaria before starting treatment. Exceptions to this principle are children under 5 years and cases of suspected severe malaria where laboratory confirmation is not immediately possible. In such circumstances, a complete course of the appropriate anti-malarial medication(s) must be given.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li><i>Plasmodium falciparum&nbsp;</i>(commonest and responsible for most of the deaths and morbidity associated with malaria in Ghana)</li><li><i>Plasmodium malariae</i></li><li><i>Plasmodium ovale</i></li></ul>
