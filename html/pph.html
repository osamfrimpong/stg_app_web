<body><p><strong><u>POST-PARTUM HAEMORRHAGE</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post-partum haemorrhage may be primary or secondary. Primary postpartum haemorrhage refers to bleeding of more than 500 ml from the genital tract within the first twenty-four hours of delivery or any amount of blood loss that result in haemodynamic compromise of the patient. It usually occurs during or immediately after the third stage of labour. Secondary post-partum haemorrhage is defined as excessive vaginal bleeding occurring from twenty-four hours to six weeks after delivery.The bleeding may occur with the placenta retained or after its expulsion from the uterus. Postpartum haemorrhage becomes life threatening if the mother is already anaemic. Blood loss of more than 500 ml may lead to shock.</p>
<h3>CAUSES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uterine atony (70-90% of cases)</li>
<li>Retention of all or part of placental tissue within the uterine cavity</li>
<li>Infection within the uterine cavity (endo-myometritis)</li>
<li>Genital tract trauma</li>
<li>Clotting disorders</li>
</ul>
<h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Excessive or prolonged vaginal bleeding after delivery</li>
<li>Lower abdominal pains</li>
</ul>
<h3>SIGNS</h3>
<p>Active bleeding from the genital tract</p>
<ul>
<li>Conjunctival pallor</li>
<li>Rapid pulse</li>
<li>Blood pressure may be low or normal</li>
<li>Deterioration of maternal levels of consciousness</li>
<li>Flabby poorly contracted uterus</li>
<li>Obvious tears in birth canal and/or perineum</li>
<li>Obvious retained placenta</li>
<li>Suprapubic tenderness</li>
</ul>
<h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC, sickling status</li>
<li>Bedside clotting test</li>
<li>Blood grouping and cross-matching</li>
<li>Ultrasound scan (if patient is stable to check for retained placenta tissue)</li>
</ul>
<h3>TREATMENT</h3>
<p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To identify the cause and stop bleeding as quickly as possible</li>
<li>To correct hypotension</li>
<li>To correct resulting anaemia</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Due to uterine atony (70-90% of cases), with no placental retention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Massage fundus of uterus to stimulate contraction</li>
<li>Encourage woman to empty bladder or pass a urethral catheter to empty the bladder and monitor urine output</li>
<li>Bimanual compression of the uterus and balloon tamponade if uterus fails to contract with massage</li>
</ul>
<h3>Due to retained placenta</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attempt removal of the placenta by controlled cord traction as soon as a contraction is felt. If not successful await the next contraction and repeat the procedure</li>
<li>If the placenta cannot be expelled in this fashion, manual removal</li>
</ul>
<p>under anaesthesia is indicated</p>
<ul>
<li>If the placenta has been delivered and is incomplete, exploration the uterus and manual removal under anaesthesia is indicated</li>
<li>If the facilities for manual removal of placenta under anaesthesia are not immediately available refer to hospital</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bleeding with uterus well contracted and placenta completely delivered</h3>
<ul>
<li>Examine the patient in the lithotomy position with adequate analgesia and/or anaesthesia, good lighting to identify and suture perineal, vaginal and cervical tears</li>
<li>If the tear(s) extends into the uterine body, effective suturing cannot</li>
</ul>
<p>be performed and repair will involve a laparotomy</p>
<ul>
<li>For ruptured uterus, repair or hysterectomy is required</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bleeding associated with coagulopathy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bedside clotting test - 5 ml of blood placed in a 10 ml round bottomed glass tube should clot in 6 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>If the uterus is poorly contracted (Atony)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxytocin, IM, 10 units</li>
</ul>
<h3>Then</h3>
<ul>
<li><br /> Oxytocin, IV, infusion, 10-40 units in 500 ml Dextrose saline or 9% or Normal saline</li>
</ul>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Misoprostol, sublingual, 600 microgram (for PPH prophylaxis within 1 minute of delivery)</li>
<li>Misoprostol, sublingual, 800 microgram stat if patient is conscious (for PPH treatment)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<p>3rd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Ergometrine, IV, 500 microgram</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<p>Evidence Rating: [B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxytocin-ergometrine, IM, (0xytocin 10 units and Ergometrine 500 microgram)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<p>Evidence Rating: [B]</p>
<ul>
<li><br /> Oxytocin-misoprostol, (0xytocin, IV, 10 units and Misoprostol, rectal, 600 micrograms)</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. Protracted bleeding uncontrolled by Oxytocin and other</h3>
<p><strong>Uterotonics or if bleeding is due partly to trauma</strong></p>
<p>Evidence Rating: [B]</p>
<ul>
<li>Tranexamic Acid, slow IV (not to exceed 100 mg per minute), 1 g</li>
</ul>
<h3>Then</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 g 8 hourly (Maximum 3 g in 24 hours)</li>
</ul>
<h3>C. Hypovolaemia</h3>

<p>(See section on <strong>'Shock'</strong>)</p>
<h3>D. Anaesthesia for manual removal of placenta</h3>
<ul>
