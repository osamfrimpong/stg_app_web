<body><p><strong><u>ANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY</u></strong></p>
<p>Anaemia in pregnancy is a haemoglobin concentration of &lt; 11 g/ dL (World Health Organisation). It is described as severe if the Hb is &lt; 7 g/dL. Anaemia has adverse effects on the health of the woman and the outcome of the pregnancy. It is associated with an increased rate of miscarriage, preterm delivery, foetal growth restriction, foetal death and increased perinatal loss. It is also associated with ante- and post-partum haemorrhage and an increased maternal mortality rate.</p>
<p>Ideally no woman should go into labour with anaemia. Appropriate measures including blood transfusion may be required to correct the anaemia especially if a woman is close to her expected delivery date.</p>
<h3>CAUSES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Physiological (due to blood volume expansion in pregnancy)</li>
<li>Poor dietary intake of iron, folate and vitamin B12</li>
<li>Haemolytic disorders (e.g. sickle cell disease, G6PD defect)</li>
<li>Malaria</li>
<li>Infestations with hookworm, ascaris, schistosomes</li>
<li>Chronic infections e.g. TB, UTI, HIV</li>
<li>Bleeding complications in pregnancy g. APH</li>
<li>SYMPTOMS</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Swelling of the feet</li>
<li>General weakness</li>
<li>Easy fatiguability</li>
</ul>
<h3>SIGNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mucosal pallor</li>
<li>Jaundice (may or may not be present)</li>
<li>Hepato-splenomegaly (may or may not be present)</li>
<li>Heart failure in severe cases</li>
</ul>
<h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC</li>
<li>Peripheral blood film comment</li>
<li>Blood film for malaria parasites</li>
<li>Sickling and Hb electrophoresis</li>
<li>G6PD activity</li>
<li>Serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin</li>
<li>Stool analysis for hookworm ova</li>
<li>Urinalysis for schistosoma ova and urobilinogen</li>
</ul>
<h3>TREATMENT</h3>
<p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To relieve symptoms</li>
<li>To correct haemoglobin level before patient reaches term or goes</li>
</ul>
<p>into labour</p>
<ul>
<li>To identify and treat underlying cause</li>
<li>To recognize and manage the associated complications in mother</li>
</ul>
<p>e.g. cardiac failure, and baby e.g. intrauterine growth restriction</p>
<h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Encourage intake of foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, dark</li>
</ul>
<p>leafy vegetables, shell fish, dried fruits which are rich in iron, folate, Vitamins B and C</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid tea, coffee, bran, cola and unhealthy habits such as eating of clay, which inhibits iron absorption</li>
<li>Encourage intake of folate and vitamin rich foods including beans, avocado, citrus fruits, spinach and mangoes</li>
<li>Protein rich foods must also be included in the diet</li>
<li>Ensure these anemic patients are seen more frequently in the antenatal clinic and their response to treatment monitored with haemoglobin level checks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence Rating: [A]</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferrous sulphate, oral, 325 mg 8 hourly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Or</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ferrous gluconate, oral, 300 mg 8-12 Evaluate after 4-6 weeks</li>
</ul>
<h3>And</h3>
<ul>
<li>Folic Acid, oral, 5 mg daily</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><br /> Blood transfusion</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Add</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Furosemide IV, 20-40 mg if giving whole blood</li>
</ul>
<h3>REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3>
<p>Refer patients with anaemia to a dietician or diet nurse for counselling and support. Treatment for severe anaemia (Hb &lt; 7g/dL) is best given in health facilities with blood transfusion capability. All women who do not respond satisfactorily to oral treatment should be referred for further evaluation. Those with associated conditions like HIV and Haemogobinopathies should be managed in the hospital. HIV patients on antiretroviral medication may need modification of their drug combinations to exclude those that aggravate anaemia e.g. zidovudine.</p>
