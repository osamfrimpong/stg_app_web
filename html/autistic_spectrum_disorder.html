<body><p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by qualitative impairments occurring in a child before the age of 36 months, in three key areas; social interaction (often the earliest features of Autistic Spectrum Disorder-ASD), communication, interests and activities.</p><p>The clinical presentation is varied and may encompass  children with severe manifestations of the above features or with more subtle behavioural deficits, hence the use of the term Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Learning disability in this condition is very common and the risk of epilepsy is significant.</p><p>ASD is increasingly being recognized in Ghana.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>No clear aetiology</li><li>Genetic</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Absence of joint attention (i.e. failure to show interest, follow gaze, lack of social smiling and limited use of gestures e.g. shaking head, waving or clapping)</li><li>Communication deficit</li><li>Receptive: fails to acquire language or delays in understanding language</li><li>Expressive: delays in use of language</li><li>Limited range of interests (limited play with toys and other objects)</li><li>Repetitive activities (e.g. spinning objects)</li><li>Global developmental delays (e.g. walking, speech etc.)</li><li>Learning difficulties</li><li>Attention deficit</li><li>Sleeping difficulties</li><li>Feeding difficulties</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>Lack of pointing to objects by 24 months</li><li>No single words by 18 months</li><li>No two word spontaneous phrase by 24 months</li><li>Loss of language</li><li>Avoidance of eye contact</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Usually none required</li><li>Electroencephalogram (EEG) if seizures suspected</li><li>Brain CT or MRI only in special circumstances e.g. abnormal physical features present</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To correct social communication difficulties using a multidisciplinary behavioural and educational approach</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) - teaching based on teacher request, prompt assistance to child, child response and feedback</li></ul><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p><strong>A.
