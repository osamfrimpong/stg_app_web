<p><strong>Pneumococcal Disease</strong></p><p>Pneumococcal disease presents more commonly as non-invasive disease in the form of non-bacteraemic pneumonia, middle-ear infections, sinusitis, or bronchitis. However, it may also manifest as Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD) in the form of pneumonia with empyema and/or bacteraemia or meningitis as a result of haematogenic spread. In developing countries, non-bacteraemic pneumonia causes the majority of pneumococcal deaths. Ninety distinct serotypes have been identified.</p><p>Pneumococcal disease is effectively prevented with Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) at 6,10 and 14 weeks for infants. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for persons older than 2 years with underlying medical conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease. Adults with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants should receive PCV13 followed by PPSV23.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i></p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p>•Fever</p><p>• Other symptoms associated with pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, septicaemia</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>• Please refer to signs and symptoms of the specific diseases in other sections</p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><p>• Culture and sensitivity of appropriate body fluids (e.g. pus from the ear in suppurative otitis media, cerebrospinal fluid in meningitis, pleural aspirate in empyema, blood).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note 5-6</strong></p><p><strong>Blood culture is only relevant in invasive pneumococcal disease and would not be helpful in uncomplicated pneumonias</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; To eliminate the bacteria</p><p>•&nbsp; To provide supportive care</p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>(See relevant sections on the presenting illness e.g. meningitis, pneumonia)</p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>(See relevant sections on the presenting illness e.g. meningitis, pneumonia)</p><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>All patients who fail to show remarkable signs of improvement in 3 days following drug treatment, or present with complications should be referred for higher-level care.</p>
