<body><p>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is short-term antiretroviral treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure by preventing the establishment of infection or preventing new infection. PEP reduces staff exposure to HIV infections at work and also clears possible HIV infection from infected dendritic cells. Workplace accidents or injury expose health workers to body fluids of patients. Risk of exposure to blood and blood borne pathogens is slightly higher for healthcare personnel. The risk of infection for HIV from a percutaneous injury is approximately 0-3% and that of mucous membranes or non- intact skin are much lower. PEP is particularly effective within 1-2 hours and not more than 72 hours after exposure.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>An exposure considered as possible risk is defined as "an exposure from possibly infected blood tissue or other body fluids through:</li><li>A percutaneous injury (e.g. a needle stick or cut with a sharp object) or</li><li>A mucocutaneous membrane or non-intact (chapped, abraded skin) contact</li><li>The risk of infection appears to be higher after:</li><li>Exposure to a large quantity of blood or to other infectious fluids</li><li>Exposure to the blood of a patient in an advanced HIV disease stage.</li><li>A deep percutaneous injury or an injury with a hollow bore, blood filled needle.</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>None</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>None</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Box 17-1 Steps to prevent occupational transmission of HIV</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>In the event of possible exposure to HIV the following actions should be taken:</p><ul><li>The wound site should be cleaned with soap and water</li><li>For mucous membranes, the exposed area should be flushed with plenty of water (e.g. eyes with water or saline)</li><li>Assess the level of risk: the risk of possible infection from the exposure should be assessed and classified based on the categories below:</li><li>Very LowExposure:<ul><li>Exposure of potentially infectious material to intact skin)</li></ul></li><li>Low RiskExposure:<ul><li>Exposure to a small volume of blood or body fluids contaminated with blood from asymptomatic HIV-positive patient</li><li>Injury with a solid needle or any superficial injury or mucocutaneous exposure</li></ul></li><li>High RiskExposure:<ul><li>Exposureto a large volume of blood or potentially infectious fluids</li><li>Exposure to blood or body fluids contaminated with blood from an HIV positive patient with high viral load</li><li>Injury with a hollow bore needle/deep and extensive injury from a contaminated sharp instrument</li><li>Exposure to blood from an HIV drug resistant patient</li></ul></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Full blood count</li><li>Liver and renal function tests</li><li>Hepatitis B Surface Antigen</li><li>HIV serology or PCR if available</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment Objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To prevent establishment of HIV infection</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Counselling and Testing:</li><li>Exposed health workers must receive counselling and testing immediately from a trained counsellor.
