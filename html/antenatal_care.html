<p>Antenatal care refers to the comprehensive care given to a pregnant woman to ensure that she goes through pregnancy, labour and the puerperium safely with the delivery of a healthy baby.</p>
<p>The recommended approach to antenatal care is known as Focused Antenatal Care. It has the following principles: emphasizes quality of care rather than quantity of care (four comprehensive antenatal visits recommended for women with normal pregnancy); individualized care that meets each woman's own medical and psychosocial needs; and disease detection instead of risk categorization based on the simple principle that all pregnant women are at risk of complications.</p>
<p>Pregnant woman should be carefully assessed at booking and at all subsequent visits to identify problems that are likely to have an adverse effect on the pregnancy. Pregnancies with risk conditions (one or more risk factors) should be seen more frequently and also referred to a hospital and/or obstetrician for management.</p>
<p>Another important component of antenatal care is the health education and counselling that is given to clients. These promote healthy behaviour and lifestyle during the pregnancy and also enable the woman to recognize danger signs in pregnancy and prepare adequately for emergencies and safe delivery. Findings at each visit should be accurately documented.</p>
<p>Antenatal Visits Schedule for a Normal Healthy Woman</p>
<p>Women who are healthy at booking and who remain healthy at subsequent visits and do not have any identified potential risk conditions may have four comprehensive visits as follows:</p>

    </div>
<p>More frequent visits or follow up schedules are implemented to meet the client's individual needs.</p>
<p>In Ghana, many clients come for their first visit during their second trimester of pregnancy. In this case, the visit schedule must be modified to ensure that the client receives all the essential components of care before childbirth.</p>
<p>Assessment of the mother at the booking visit</p>
<ul>
<li>Take detailed history (present health, past medical and surgical history, past obstetric history, family and social history)</li>
<li>Confirm the last menstrual period and established gestational age</li>
<li>Examine from head to toe and all body systems including a check for anaemia, blood pressure, pulse, general health status and manage appropriately</li>
<li>Conduct obstetric examination to confirm pregnancy, measure uterine size (SFH) and assess foetal wellbeing (FHR).</li>
<li>Request for/ conduct screening test as per national protocol (See list of investigations)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment of the mother at follow-up visits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask about mother's health status since last visit and ask about health</li>
</ul>
<p>concerns</p>
<ul>
<li>Enquire about foetal activity (gestation &gt; 20 weeks)</li>
<li>Test urine for albumin and sugar</li>
<li>Examine mother for weight gain, anaemia, and for complications such as pre-eclampsia and manage appropriately</li>
<li>Check blood pressure (the upper limit of normal is 140 mmHg for the systolic pressure and 90 mmHg for the diastolic pressure).</li>
<li>Obstetric examination:</li>
<li>Measure Uterine size: measure symphysio-fundal height in cen- timetres between 20 and 36 weeks</li>
<li>Check the lie, presentation and position of the baby and the descent of the presenting part (3rd trimester). Check the foetal heart sounds. Normal rate is 120-160 beats per minute.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>INVESTIGATIONS</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full blood count (at booking, 28 and 36 weeks or more frequently if indicated)</li>
<li>Fasting blood glucose must be done on all pregnant women (at booking, 28 and 32 weeks) See note below</li>
<li>Haemoglobin level (at booking, 28 and 36 weeks or more frequently if indicated)</li>
<li>Blood film for malaria parasites</li>
<li>Sickling (if necessary Hb electrophoresis)</li>
<li>G6PD activity</li>
<li>Urine analysis at each visit (proteinuria, glucosuria)</li>
<li>Stool analysis at booking</li>
<li>Blood group and antibody screen</li>
<li>VDRL/TPHA/RPR test</li>
<li>HBsAg test</li>
<li>HIV antibody testing (counselling required before testing)</li>
<li>Ultrasound scan:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Early ultrasound scan for foetal age estimation and to exclude ectopic pregnancy</li>
<li>Foetal anomaly scanning at 18-24 weeks is beneficial</li>
<li>Late screening at 36 weeks (placenta position, foetal well being etc.)</li>
</ul>
