<body><p>Peptic ulcer may be duodenal or gastric. Duodenal ulcers are more common and occur more often in younger adults. Gastric ulcers usually occur after middle age. Gastric ulcers should be taken seriously because they may be malignant.</p><p>Peptic ulcers may lead to life threatening complications of bleeding, perforation and gastric outlet obstruction.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><p>•  Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection</p><p>•  Excessive secretion of gastric acid</p><p>•  Inadequate protection of the lining of the stomach and duodenum against digestion by acid and pepsin</p><p>•  Medicines e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p>•           Episodic abdominal pain (often aggravated by dietary indiscretions and lifestyle)</p><p>•  May be a minor discomfort, gnawing, burning, dull ache or very severe pain</p><p>•  Typically pain is in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium</p><p>•  Occasionally high up behind the sternum or low down around the umbilicus</p><p>•  In duodenal ulcer, pain typically comes on when the patient is hungry and may wake the patient up in the middle of the night.</p><p>•  In gastric ulcer, it is typically worsened by food, and may be re- lieved by vomiting</p><p>•  Is relieved by alkalis and food in duodenal ulcer</p><p>•           Vomiting may occur in both duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is usually a complication in duodenal ulcer (gastric outlet obstruction) but may be self-induced in gastric ulcer to relieve pain</p><p><strong>In children</strong></p><p>•  Pain may be peri-umbilical</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>•  There may be no abdominal signs</p><p>•  Weight loss (sometimes in gastric ulcer)</p><p>•  Weight gain (sometimes in duodenal ulcer)</p><p>•  Tenderness - epigastrium, right hypochondrium or umbilical region</p><p> </p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><p>•  Haemoglobin</p><p>•  H. pylori stool antigen</p><p>•  Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (endoscopy)</p><p>•  Barium meal (in the absence of endoscopy)</p><p>•  Stool examination (to exclude intestinal parasites)</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p>•  To relieve pain (dyspepsia) and reduce gastric acid secretion</p><p>•  To eradicate H. pylori if present</p><p>•  To promote healing of the ulcer</p><p>•  To prevent recurrence of the ulcer</p><p>•  To prevent and manage complications</p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>•  Avoid alcohol and tobacco intake</p><p>•  Avoid foods that aggravate the pain</p><p>•  Allay anxiety and stress</p><p>•  Surgical treatment: for chronic cases with severe periodic attacks, failed medical treatment and complications e.g. perforation, gastric outlet obstruction and haemorrhage)</p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p><strong>A.   Dyspepsia</strong></p><p><strong>1st Line treatment </strong></p><p><strong>Evidence Rating: [A]</strong></p><p>• Magnesium trisilicate, oral, 15 ml 8 hourly (in-between meals and at bedtime to control dyspepsia)</p><p><strong>Or</strong><br>• Aluminium hydroxide, oral, 500 mg 6 hourly (in-between meals and at bedtime)</p><p><strong>2nd Line treatment </strong></p><p><strong>Evidence Rating: [A]</strong></p><p>• Omeprazole, oral,</p><p><strong><u>Adults</u></strong></p><p>20 mg daily for 4 weeks. Repeat course if ulcer is not fully healed.</p><p><strong>B. NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer and gastro-duodenal erosions</strong></p><p><strong>Evidence Rating: [A]</strong></p><p>•Esomeprazole, oral,</p><p><strong>Adults</strong></p><p>20 mg daily for 4 weeks. Repeat course if ulcer is not fully healed.</p><p><strong>Or</strong></p><p>•Omeprazole, oral,</p><p><strong><u>Adults</u></strong></p><p>20 mg daily for 4 weeks. Repeat course if ulcer is not fully healed.</p><p><strong>Or</strong></p><p>•Pantoprazole, oral,</p><p><strong><u>Adults</u></strong></p><p>20-40 mg daily for 4 weeks. Repeat course if ulcer is not fully healed.</p><p><strong>C.   Bleeding peptic ulcer (may be an indication for surgery)</strong></p><p>Evidence Rating: [A]</p><p>•Esomeprazole, IV,</p><p><strong><u>Adults</u></strong></p><p>40 mg daily</p><p><strong>Or</strong></p><p>•Omeprazole, IV,</p><p><strong>Adults</strong></p><p>40 mg 12 hourly for up to 5 days</p><p><strong>D.   </strong><i><strong>Helicobacter pylori Eradication</strong></i></p><p>Majority of patients presenting with duodenal ulcer are infected with Helicobacter pylori. Eradication of H. pylori should therefore be done using a 10-14 day course of treatment consisting of a PPI plus a combination of two of the antibiotics indicated in the table below.</p><p>
