<body><p><strong>Immunisation</strong></p><p>Immunisation against vaccine preventable diseases through the national Expanded Programme for Immunisation (EPI) is one of the most effective measures of reducing morbidity, disability and mortality in the population, especially, in children.</p><p>Ghana currently has 12 (twelve) vaccines in the immunisation schedule, namely, BCG, oral poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcus, rotavirus, measles, rubella and yellow fever. Newer vaccines may be introduced in the near future as they are discovered and found effective.</p><p> </p><p>Immunisation is recommended for the following persons:</p><p> • High risk groups (e.g. during a disease outbreak or by virtue of being exposed)</p><p> • Young children</p><p> • Elderly</p><p> • The malnourished</p><p> </p><p>The current schedule for routine Immunisation for children under 5 years is as follows:</p><p>Evidence Rating [A]</p>

    <p><strong>Immunisation of preterm babies:</strong></p><p> • Consider all premature babies for full immunisation course.</p><p> • Start immunisation in 2nd month after birth (after 4 weeks) irrespective of degree of prematurity. Give BCG on discharge.</p><p> • Delay OPV in neonatal unit since there is a small chance of transfer of 0PV virus to other babies. Hence give 0PV on discharge from nursery</p><p>- not while still on admission.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Contraindications to Immunisation:</strong></p><p> • Current serious febrile illness: delay vaccine</p><p> • History of severe reaction after previous dose (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) - avoid</p><p> • Evolving neurological disease (e.g. uncontrolled epilepsy) - avoid whole cell pertussis vaccine</p><p> • No DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib to child with convulsion/shock within 3 days of the most recent dose of DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib</p><p> • No DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib to child with recurrent convulsions or active CNS disease</p><p> • Yellow fever vaccine should not be given if there is history of anaphylaxis with ingestion of egg</p><p> • Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection should not receive BCG and yellow fever vaccines since these are live vaccines. BCG vaccine can be given at birth since the HIV infected newborn is asymptomatic.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Live vaccines should not be given to the following:</strong></p><p> • Pregnant women - for risk of teratogenic effect</p><p> • Patients with malignant disease e.g. leukaemia, Hodgkins disease</p><p> • Malignant disease of the reticuloendothelial system,</p><p> • Patients with immune suppression, including Symptomatic HIV patients</p><p> • Patients on chemotherapy (defer for 6 months after stopping chemotherapy treatment)</p><p><strong>However</strong>:</p><p> • Measles vaccine should be given to HIV positive patients even though it is a live vaccine because the benefit outweighs the risk</p><p> </p><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Refer all problems related to Immunisation to a paediatrician or EPI specialist.</p>
