<body><p><strong>Measles</strong></p><p>Measles is an acute infectious disease, which usually occurs in children between 6 months and 3 years who have not been immunised, or completed the full immunisation schedule. It is prevented by 2 doses of measles vaccination at 9 and 18 months. The condition is very infectious from up to 7 days before, to 5 days after, appearance of the rash.</p><p>Complications include otitis media, with or without deafness, bronchopneumonia, croup, diarrhoea, vitamin A deficiency leading to xerophthalmia and blindness, malnutrition and activation of latent tuberculosis. Seriously ill measles patients requiring admission should be isolated. There is no specific treatment for measles. Antibiotics are not required, except for some specific complications.</p><p>Measles diagnosis is mainly clinical. The disease is now uncommon because of immunisation. However, high immunisation coverage needs to be maintained to keep the disease under control. Report all cases to the District Disease Control 0fficer for appropriate action.</p><p><strong>CAUSE</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; Measles virus</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; Runny nose</p><p>•&nbsp; Cough</p><p>•&nbsp; Red eyes</p><p>•&nbsp; Sore mouth</p><p>•&nbsp; High fever, present before the rash appears</p><p>•&nbsp; Rash - starts on face and neck</p><p>•&nbsp; Diarrhoea</p><p>•&nbsp; Child is generally miserable</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; Fever</p><p>•&nbsp; Conjunctivitis</p><p>•&nbsp; Koplik spots (white grain-like spots on the buccal mucosa 2 days before rash)</p><p>•&nbsp; Rash - itchy, generalised maculo-papular</p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; Usually none</p><p>•&nbsp; Measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody assay if required</p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; To relieve symptoms</p><p>•&nbsp; To maintain good nutrition</p><p>•&nbsp; To prevent and treat complications</p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; Tepid sponging for fever</p><p>•&nbsp; Encourage oral hygiene with frequent saline mouth wash</p><p>•&nbsp; Continue feeding with soft high calorie foods</p><p>•&nbsp; Wash eyes with clean water</p><p>•&nbsp; Discourage use of harsh items on skin</p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p><strong>A.&nbsp; For pain and fever</strong></p><p>Evidence Rating: [C]</p><p>•&nbsp; Paracetamol, oral,</p><p><u>Adults</u></p><p>500 mg-1g 6-8 hourly</p><p><u>Children</u></p><p>6-12 years; &nbsp;&nbsp; 250-500 mg 6-8 hourly</p><p>1-5 years;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 120-250 mg 6-8 hourly</p><p>3 months-1 year;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60-120 mg 6-8 hourly</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B.&nbsp; To prevent eye complications due to Vitamin A deficiency</strong></p><p>Evidence Rating: [A]</p><p>•&nbsp; Vitamin A, oral,</p><p><u>Children</u></p><p>&gt;1 year;&nbsp; 200,000 units daily for 2 days</p><p>6-11 months;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100,000 units daily for 2 days</p><p>&lt; 6 months;&nbsp; 50,000 units daily for 2 days</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>C.&nbsp; For management of associated diarrhoea with dehydration</strong></p><p>(See section on 'Diarrhoea')</p><p><strong>D.&nbsp; For management of associated pneumonia and otitis media</strong></p><p>(See relevant sections)</p><p><strong>E.&nbsp; For relief of skin irritation</strong></p><p>•&nbsp; Calamine lotion (apply liberally to the whole skin)</p><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Refer patients with complications such as a black (haemorrhagic) rash, stridor, pneumonia, coma, great difficulty in eating or drinking, dehydration or malnutrition to the hospital.</p>
