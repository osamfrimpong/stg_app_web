<body><p>Overweight and obesity are associated with conditions that cause premature ill-health and death, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease and stroke.&nbsp; 0ther&nbsp; conditions such as gout, obstructive sleep apnoea, gallstones, heartburn, arthritis, skin infections as well as various cancers have been linked to excess body weight. They also increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as elevated blood cholesterol, which increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>Weight reduction often corrects, or helps to control, these associated conditions. 0ccasionally rapid weight gain may be associated with an underlying endocrine condition such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Excess intake of calories</li><li>Lack of regular physical activity</li><li>Secondary causes e.g. hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Usually none</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>Body Mass Index (BMI) increased</li><li>18.5-24.9 kg/m2 - Ideal weight</li><li>25.0-29.9 kg/m2 - 0verweight</li><li>30.0-34.9 kg/m2 - 0bese</li><li>&gt; 35.0 kg/m2  - Severely obese</li><li>Mid-abdominal (waist) girth, taken roughly at the level of the umbilicus, increased</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Adult females:</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; 80 cm or 32 inches</td><td>Ideal abdominal girth</td></tr><tr><td>80 - 88 cm or 32-35 inches</td><td>Overweight</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;88 cm or 35 inches</td><td>Obese</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Adult males:</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; 94 cm or 37 inches</td><td>Ideal abdominal girth</td></tr><tr><td>94 - 102 cm or 37 - 40 inches</td><td>Overweight</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;102 cm or 40 inches</td><td>Obese</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Blood glucose</li><li>Blood lipid profile</li><li>Blood uric acid</li><li>ECG</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To ensure a loss of 10% of the initial body weight, within 6 months, at a rate of no more than 2-4 kg per month</li><li>To attain the ideal BMI and/or abdominal girth</li><li>To sustain the weight reduction achieved</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Weight reduction diet, preferably under the supervision of a dietician</li><li>Regular physical activity comprising 30 minutes brisk walking, or equivalent activity, for a minimum of 3 days per week if there are no contraindications</li><li>Appropriate management of associated co-morbid disorders</li></ul><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Approved anti-obesity treatments are available but should only be given under specialist guidance</li></ul><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Individuals with severe and morbid obesity may require referral to a physician specialist and occasionally may need psychological counselling.
