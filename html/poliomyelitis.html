<p><strong>Poliomyelitis</strong></p><p>Poliomyelitis is a viral disease, which is spread by faecal-oral or oral- to-oral transmission. Insanitary disposal of excreta and use of unsafe drinking water contribute to the spread. The disease is characterised by varying degrees of acute flaccid paralysis, which commonly persists.</p><p>Paralysis commonly affects one lower limb but any group of skeletal muscles, including the muscles of respiration and bulbar cells in the brain may be affected.</p><p>Poliomyelitis is commonly acquired in childhood. The infection is often sub-clinical and may only appear as a mild flu-like illness. 0nly few cases progress to develop paralysis. However, injections during periods of the febrile illness are associated with an increased incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis.</p><p>Poliomyelitis is preventable by Immunisation. Prevention is almost certain if 4 doses of oral polio vaccine are given as in the EPI schedule. Rarely Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP) may occur in recipients of oral polio vaccines and their unimmunised contacts. This is usually associated with polio virus type 2.</p><p><strong>Note 5-1</strong></p><p><strong>All cases of poliomyelitis should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer for follow-up.</strong></p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 or 3</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fever</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Headache</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sore throat</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muscle pain</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flaccid paralysis</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute flaccid paralysis of affected muscles</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diminished or absent muscle reflexes</p><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two fresh stool samples taken 24-48 hours apart (to be sent on ice to the Regional Public Health Reference Laboratory for confirmation)</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide supportive care till patient recovers from acute illness</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid or limit the extent of paralysis</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide rehabilitation in paralytic cases</p><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bed rest</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid injections during febrile illness in children</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physiotherapy</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provision of appropriate appliances to aid mobility</p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No specific antiviral treatment</p><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Refer all patients with difficulty in breathing and swallowing for hospital admission.</p>
