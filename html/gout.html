<body><p>This condition, which typically affects males with cardiovascular risk factors and women after menopause, results from the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and periarticular tissues. Gout is characterized by pain and inflammation of the affected joints. It is often, but not always, associated with raised blood uric acid levels and may be present even when the level of uric acid in the blood is normal, while patients with highlevelsofuricacidmaynotnecessarilyhaveattacksofgout.Individual gout flares are often triggered by acute increases or decreases in uric acid levels which may be associated with acute alcohol ingestion, acute overindulgence in foods high in purines, rapid weight loss, dehydration, or trauma.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Overproduction of uric acid in disorders that cause high cell turnover with release of purines found in cell nuclei<ul><li>Myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders</li><li>Psoriasis</li><li>Hemolytic anemias</li><li>Cell lysis from chemotherapy, especially those of the haemato- poietic or lymphatic systems</li><li>Excessive exercise</li><li>Metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol etc.)</li></ul></li><li>Impaired excretion of uric acid<ul><li>Renal impairment</li><li>Lead nephropathy</li><li>Starvation or dehydration</li><li>Drugs e.g. thiazide and loop diuretics, cytotoxic drugs, pyrazine- amide</li><li>Alcohol ingestion</li></ul></li><li>Inherited purine metabolic disorders e.g. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Excruciating pain and swelling usually of a joint (classically the big toe but may affect the knee, ankles or wrists)</li><li>Multiple joint pain</li><li>Joint swelling</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>Inflamed, swollen and tender joint</li><li>Migratory polyarthritis</li><li>Tophi in soft tissues (helix of the ear, fingers, toes, prepatellar bursa, olecranon)</li><li>Fever</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>FBC, ESR</li><li>BUE,creatinine</li><li>Serum uricacid</li><li>Blood glucose</li><li>Serum lipids</li><li>X-ray of affectedjoint</li><li>Joint aspirate for culture and polarised microscopy</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To relieve acute pain</li><li>To reduce joint inflammation</li><li>To prevent recurrent attacks and joint damage</li><li>To prevent uric acid crystal deposition in soft tissues</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Optimize weight</li><li>Reduce protein in diet e.g. liver, kidneys, shellfish and yeast extracts</li><li>Reduce alcohol intake to &lt; 14 units/week (men and women)</li><li>Avoid highly sweetened soft drinks and other beverages or foods</li><li>Encourage to drink &gt; 2 litres of water daily and avoid dehydration.</li><li>Affected joints should be elevated and exposed in a cool environment.
