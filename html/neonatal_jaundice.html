<body><p>Jaundice in the neonate may be visible when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 100 micromol/L. Neonatal jaundice is important because of the consequences of hyperbilirubinaema on the brain of the newborn. This condition is called kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) and may cause death. Infants who survive may be handicapped with cerebral palsy, and associated deafness, mental retardation and motor incoordination.</p><p>Approximately 80% of newborns will be jaundiced in the first week of life and most of this is physiological. This occurs on day 3 and lasts up to 10 days. This jaundice is mild and the baby remains healthy.</p><p>Jaundice in the neonate is likely to be pathological if it is present within the first day of life; or conjugated (direct) bilirubin is more than 40 micromol/L; or total bilirubin is more than 170 micromol/L in preterm and more than 260 micromol/L in the term infant; or the neonate is significantly jaundiced beyond 14 days or has jaundice with fever.</p><p>Exchange transfusion is the definitive treatment for hyperbilirubinaemia that has reached the level where kernicterus may occur.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Physiological</li><li>Haemolysis - Rhesus, AB0 incompatibility, G6PD deficiency</li><li>Blood extravasation - cephalhaematoma, subgaleal haematoma</li><li>Sepsis</li><li>Congenital infections</li><li>Liver disease</li><li>Metabolic disorders - galactosemia, hypothyroidism</li><li>Enhanced extra hepatic circulation - GIT obstruction, inadequate feeding</li><li>Congenital defects of bilirubin metabolism</li><li>Breast milk related jaundice</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Yellow eyes</li><li>Yellow skin, hands and feet</li><li>Pale stools (biliary atresia likely)</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>Jaundice</li><li>Yellow pigment in skin</li><li>Yellow palms +/- yellow soles of feet</li><li>Pale stools (biliary atresia likely)</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Total and direct serum bilirubin concentration</li><li>Other investigations as below, dependent on age at presentation and</li><li>suspected cause:</li></ul><p><strong>Early onset (within first 24 hours of birth)</strong></p><ul><li>Blood group and rhesus (Rh) group of both infant and mother</li><li>Direct Coombs test, Indirect Coombs test, FBC, G6PD</li><li>Blood film for red cell anomalies, malaria parasites</li><li>Cultures of blood, urine, and spinal fluid may be indicated by the history, physical examination or initial laboratory findings</li></ul><p><strong>Prolonged jaundice (after 14 days)</strong></p><ul><li>Liver Function tests</li><li>Thyroid Function tests</li><li>Urine for reducing substances</li><li>Urine R/E and C/S</li><li>TORCH (congenital infections) screen</li><li>Hep B</li><li>Abdominal ultrasound scan (exclude biliary atresia)</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To prevent kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy)</li><li>To detect and treat underlying cause</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Phototherapy (See note below on 'Phototherapy')</li><li>Exchange blood transfusion (See note below on 'Exchange transfusion')</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Box 6-1: Phototherapy</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Phototherapy is started if:</p><ul><li>Jaundice is visible on day 1</li><li>Jaundice involves palms and soles of feet</li><li>Jaundice in prematurity</li><li>After day 2, measured level of unconjugated bilirubin is more than 170 mi- cromol/L in preterm or more than 260 micromol/L in term neonate.</li></ul><p>A phototherapy unit with blue fluorescent tube lights is preferred.
