BPH is the commonest cause of male urinary symptoms in Ghana. The average age at which lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH occurs is about 50 years. Men may seek treatment for LUTS either because the symptoms are bothersome or they feel that it may lead to acute urinary retention or out of fear that it may be an indication of prostate cancer.</span> <span >It is important to establish what the patient wants from the consultation. In some patients, once reassured that the likelihood of urinary retention and prostate cancer is low, they may not wish treatment. for the symptoms.</span> <span >Currently available medicines can either relax prostatic smooth muscles or cause reduction in the prostate size and therefore ease the symptoms of BPH. A combination of available medications, especially in patients with a prostate size more than 40 ml, produce better responses than monotherapy.</span> <span >BPH may lead to complications such as recurrent urinary tract infection, acute urine retention with painful distension of the bladder, chronic urine retention with painless gross distension of the bladder, haematuria, and renal failure.</span></p><p> </p>
