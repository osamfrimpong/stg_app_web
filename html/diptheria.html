<body><p><strong>Diphtheria</strong></p><p>The bacteria responsible for this disease produces a toxin that damages human body tissues and organs. It commonly affects the tonsils and sometimes the skin causing ulcers. It is spread mainly by respiratory droplets from person to person, and less commonly through skin contact. Infected patients may recover after initial symptoms and signs or develop severe weakness and die within 6-10 days. Complications may develop in the early phase of the disease or weeks later such as abnormal heartbeat and heart failure, damage to valves of the heart, or respiratory</p><p>obstruction leading to death.</p><p>The disease is now uncommon because of immunisation. However, high immunisation coverage needs to be maintained to keep the disease under control because it has a high mortality rate.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Note 5-2</strong></p><p><strong>All cases of diphtheria should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><p> • <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i></p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><p> • Sore throat</p><p> • Loss of appetite</p><p> • Slight fever</p><p> • Dysphagia</p><p> • Difficulty in breathing with or without stridor</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p> • Greyish white membrane or patch in the throat and on tonsils within 2-3 days of the onset of symptoms.
