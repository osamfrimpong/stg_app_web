<body><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >This refers&nbsp;to a group of disorders characterized by malignant proliferation of lymphoid tissue usually presenting as lymph node swellings. There are 2 major histological types distinguished by the presence or absence of the Reed Sternberg (RS) cell. The 2 main groups are Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell present) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell&nbsp;absent).&nbsp;No&nbsp;age&nbsp;is&nbsp;exempt&nbsp;although generally&nbsp;the&nbsp;incidence&nbsp;of&nbsp;non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) increases with age and immunosuppression while Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) shows a bimodal peak, in that there is a high incidence in the third and seventh&nbsp;decades. Burkitt's lymphoma, a subtype of NHL, is one of the fastest growing tumours known in man. There are three clinical variants - the endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency associated forms. The endemic form is found in tropical and malaria endemic regions like Ghana and commonly presents as a jaw swelling with loosening of the associated teeth. In Ghana, it is the commonest childhood malignancy. It has a peak age incidence at 4-7 years with a male preponderance.</span></p><h3>CAUSES</h3><ul><li>Often&nbsp;unknown</li><li>Associated aetiological&nbsp;agents<ul><li>Chronic antigenic stimulation by <i>Helicobacter pylori&nbsp;</i>infection in gastric lymphoma</li><li>Viruses e.g. herpes virus 8, epstein-barr virus,&nbsp;HTLV-1</li><li>Chemicals e.g. pesticides, herbicides</li><li>Wood dust</li></ul></li></ul><h3>SYMPTOMS</h3><ul><li>Lymph node swelling which may wax and wane</li><li>Jaw swelling (in Burkitts)</li><li>Fever</li><li>Night sweats</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Easy&nbsp;fatiguability</li><li>Abdominal&nbsp;distension,&nbsp;intestinal&nbsp;obstruction&nbsp;(in abdominal lymphomas)</li></ul><h3>SIGNS</h3><ul><li>Firm, rubbery, non-tender lymph&nbsp;nodes</li><li>Splenomegaly</li><li>Superior vena cava syndrome (if bulky mediastinal masses are present)</li><li>Pallor (if marrow has been involved)</li></ul><h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3><ul><li>Lymph node biopsy (of a significantly enlarged&nbsp;node)</li><li>Fine needle aspiration (in Burkitts)</li><li>FBC and blood film comment</li><li>Chest X-ray,&nbsp;abdominal USG, CT scan when&nbsp;necessary</li><li>Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy</li></ul><h3>TREATMENT</h3><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;cure</li><li>To&nbsp;provide supportive treatment (pain relief, transfusion support, treat infections,counselling)</li></ul><h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3><ul><li>Ensure good&nbsp;hydration</li><li>Counselling and education</li></ul><h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3><p><span ><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma&nbsp;(NHL)</strong></span></p><p><span ><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]</strong></span></p><h3>Supportive treatment</h3><ul><li>Pain relief (avoid NSAIDS)</li><li>Packed red cells transfusion and platelet transfusion when&nbsp;indicated</li><li>IV and oral fluids</li><li>Allopurinol to mitigate tumour&nbsp;lysis</li><li>Treatment&nbsp;of&nbsp;infections</li></ul><h3>Specific treatment</h3><ul><li>Available at specialized tertiary centres&nbsp;only</li></ul><h3>REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3><p><span >All patients should be referred to a haematologist at a specialised tertiary centre.</span></p>
