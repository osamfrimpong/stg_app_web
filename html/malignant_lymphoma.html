<body><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >This refers to a group of disorders characterized by malignant proliferation of lymphoid tissue usually presenting as lymph node swellings. There are 2 major histological types distinguished by the presence or absence of the Reed Sternberg (RS) cell. The 2 main groups are Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell present) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell absent). No age is exempt although generally the incidence of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) increases with age and immunosuppression while Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) shows a bimodal peak, in that there is a high incidence in the third and seventh decades. Burkitt's lymphoma, a subtype of NHL, is one of the fastest growing tumours known in man. There are three clinical variants - the endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency associated forms. The endemic form is found in tropical and malaria endemic regions like Ghana and commonly presents as a jaw swelling with loosening of the associated teeth. In Ghana, it is the commonest childhood malignancy. It has a peak age incidence at 4-7 years with a male preponderance.</span></p><h3>CAUSES</h3><ul><li>Often unknown</li><li>Associated aetiological agents<ul><li>Chronic antigenic stimulation by <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>infection in gastric lymphoma</li><li>Viruses e.g. herpes virus 8, epstein-barr virus, HTLV-1</li><li>Chemicals e.g. pesticides, herbicides</li><li>Wood dust</li></ul></li></ul><h3>SYMPTOMS</h3><ul><li>Lymph node swelling which may wax and wane</li><li>Jaw swelling (in Burkitts)</li><li>Fever</li><li>Night sweats</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Easy fatiguability</li><li>Abdominal distension, intestinal obstruction (in abdominal lymphomas)</li></ul><h3>SIGNS</h3><ul><li>Firm, rubbery, non-tender lymph nodes</li><li>Splenomegaly</li><li>Superior vena cava syndrome (if bulky mediastinal masses are present)</li><li>Pallor (if marrow has been involved)</li></ul><h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3><ul><li>Lymph node biopsy (of a significantly enlarged node)</li><li>Fine needle aspiration (in Burkitts)</li><li>FBC and blood film comment</li><li>Chest X-ray, abdominal USG, CT scan when necessary</li><li>Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy</li></ul><h3>TREATMENT</h3><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To provide a cure</li><li>To provide supportive treatment (pain relief, transfusion support, treat infections,counselling)</li></ul><h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3><ul><li>Ensure good hydration</li><li>Counselling and education</li></ul><h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3><p><span ><strong>A.
