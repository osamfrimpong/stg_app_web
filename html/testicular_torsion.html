This is a medical emergency that needs to be recognized before the cardinal signs and symptoms are fully manifest as prompt</span> <span >surgery saves the testes. Delay in treatment could result in testicular atrophy, abnormal sperm count leading to infertility/sterility. It can be classified into intravaginal torsion, which constitute more than 95% and extra-vaginal torsion, which is usually found in infants. About 50% of torsion occurs during sleep and early in the morning. It is rare in older children and adults but common in children under 15 years.</span></p><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">CAUSES</h3><ul><li>Undescended testis</li><li>Bell-clapper malformation</li><li>Horizontal lie of testis/inversion of testis</li><li>Long mesorchium</li><li>Trauma</li><li>Spasm of cremaster muscles</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">SYMPTOMS</h3><ul><li>Sudden onset of acute severe pain in one testicle or recurrent pain which resolves spontaneously (recurrent torsion and detorsion)</li><li>Pain may occur typically early in the morning</li><li>Lower abdominal pain on affected side</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>No urinary symptoms</li><li>No fever</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">SIGNS</h3><ul><li>Swollen, tender and abnormal position of testis and epididymis.</li><li>Shortened &amp; twisted cord.</li><li>Oedema/reddening of scrotal wall</li><li>Right testis - twisted clockwise</li><li>Left testis - twisted anticlockwise</li><li>Prehn's sign is absent(elevation of scrotum in the palm towards the Pubic symphysis does not relieve pain)</li></ul><p> </p><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">INVESTIGATIONS</h3><ul><li>Urinalysis</li><li>FBC</li><li>Doppler stethoscope</li><li>Colour Doppler Ultrasound Scan</li><li>99mTc-pertechnetate scintillation scan (90-100% accurate)</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">TREATMENT</h3><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To have surgical intervention within 6 hours of onset</li><li>To surgically explore all doubtful cases</li><li>To prevent testicular loss</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">Non-pharmacological treatment</h3><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Emergency surgery is the standard treatment</li><li style="text-align:justify;">If surgery is delayed then manual detorsion should be carried out carefully to prevent loss of testis.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"> Manual detorsion procedure-under  local  anaesthesia (see  below) and standing at the foot of bed untwist: Right testis anticlockwise, Left testis – clockwise</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Emergency surgery should follow this procedure as soon as possible</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;">Pharmacological treatment</h3><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span >Evidence Rating: [C]</span></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Lignocaine 1%, into the spermatic cord on both sides - for cord block anaesthesia 10-20 ml</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span >Refer as soon as possible (if surgical intervention is not available) to a surgeon or urologist.
