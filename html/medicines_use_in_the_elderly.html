<body><p>Prescribing for older patients presents unique challenges. Many medications need to be used with special caution because of age-related changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug as well as the physiologic effects of the drug. In particular, physiologic changes in body composition, renal and hepatic functions play vital roles in determining changes in drug levels and the risk of adverse drug events in the elderly.</p><p>There is also the issue of multi-morbidity in the elderly, which leads to the prescribing of multiple medications. The more medications prescribed for an elderly person, the higher the risk of adverse effects and other drug interactions.</p><p>The 'Beers criteria' (The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel) gives a list of medications considered inappropriate for older patients; either because of ineffectiveness or high risk for adverse events.</p><p><strong>CAUSES OF ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Polypharmacy</li><li>Use of inappropriate medications</li><li>Underutilization of appropriate medication</li><li>Transitions in care settings</li></ul><p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>Prevent Adverse Drug Events (ADE)</li></ul><p><strong>Preventive measures</strong></p><ul><li>Education on drug use for the elderly and their families or caregivers</li><li>Proper drug history taking by the healthcare provider</li><li>Quality measures of drug prescribing</li></ul><ol><li>Avoidance of inappropriate medications</li><li>Appropriate use of indicated medications</li><li>&nbsp;Monitoring for side effects and drug levels</li><li>Avoidance of drug-drug and drug-food interactions</li><li>Involvement of the patient/family and integration of patient values</li></ol><ul><li>Maintenance of an accurate list of all medications that a patient is currently using</li><li>Periodic 'polythene bag check-ups'; i.e. instruct patients to bring all&nbsp; pill bottles and containers on each medical visit (including empty packets and containers); these should be checked against the medication list</li><li>Patients should be made aware of potential drug confusions i.e. sound-alike names, look-alike pills, and combination medications</li><li>Inform patients of both generic and brand names, including spelling, as well as the reasons for taking their medications</li><li>Medicine organisers prepared by the pharmacist, can also be helpful in ensuring that patients take their medications correctly</li></ul><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;Medication Question Checklist</strong></td></tr><tr><td><ol><li>Is there a clear indication for this&nbsp;medication?</li><li>Is it&nbsp;working?</li><li>Are there side&nbsp;effects?</li><li>Is the patient taking the medication&nbsp;routinely?</li><li>Does the medication need lab&nbsp;monitoring?</li><li>Is it still&nbsp;needed?</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Principles of Rational Drug Prescribing for Elderly Patients</strong></td></tr><tr><td><ol><li>Periodically update and review the medication&nbsp;list</li><li>Work&nbsp;with the community pharmacist</li><li>Educate the patient about the&nbsp;medication</li><li>Consider&nbsp;an&nbsp;adverse&nbsp;drug&nbsp;event&nbsp;(ADE)as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cause&nbsp;of&nbsp;any&nbsp;new&nbsp;patient symptom</li><li>Simplify the medication&nbsp;regimen</li><li>Start one medication at a time, at lowest possible dose</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
