In the wrong circumstances life-saving medicines can do more harm than good. Doctors, pharmacists and nurses can help their patients by checking their treatment charts in hospital or at the outpatients department. The medicines listed below may cause renal impairment and must therefore be stopped or not prescribed in patients with deteriorating renal function. All medicines in this table should be dosed based on kidney function (estimated GFR). Avoid concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications and diuretics. Monitor renal function before and during treatment. Patient-related risk factors for all these medicines include age, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, and concurrent use of nephrotoxic medicines</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span >.</span></p>
