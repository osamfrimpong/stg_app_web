All medicines in this table should be dosed based on kidney function (estimated GFR). Avoid concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications and diuretics. Monitor renal function before and during treatment. Patient-related risk factors for all these medicines include age, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, and concurrent use of nephrotoxic medicines</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span >.</span></p>
