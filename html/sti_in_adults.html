<body><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) result in several clinical syndromes caused by organisms that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">They cause acute morbidity in adults and may result in long-term complications such as urethral stricture, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, anal fistula, cervical cancer, foetal wastage, prematurity, low birth weight, ophthalmia neonatorum and congenital syphilis. Their control is the cornerstone in improving reproductive health and reducing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">Comprehensive management of STI is important and comprises prompt and effective case detection and treatment. However,&nbsp;owing to the&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of&nbsp;laboratory&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;and&nbsp;manpower in&nbsp;primary&nbsp;care&nbsp;facilities where most patients first present, an accurate diagnosis is often not possible. Also with most STIs, one cannot usually tell which organism is causing the infection from the history and physical examination alone. Multiple infections also occur,&nbsp;with each needing to be treated. Failure&nbsp;to treat one infection adequately may result in the development of serious complications.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">It is&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;more&nbsp;practical in managing STIs&nbsp;to&nbsp;base&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;on&nbsp;a 'syndromic&nbsp;diagnosis',</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">which&nbsp;identifies&nbsp;all&nbsp;STIs&nbsp;that&nbsp;could&nbsp;cause&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;symptom&nbsp;or&nbsp;sign&nbsp;and&nbsp;provide treatment&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;of&nbsp;them&nbsp;simultaneously. The&nbsp;common&nbsp;clinical&nbsp;syndromes&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;STIs&nbsp;include urethral discharge in males, persistent/recurrent urethral&nbsp;discharge,&nbsp;vaginal discharge,&nbsp;lower abdominal pain, genital ulcer,&nbsp;scrotal&nbsp;swellings, inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes), ano-rectal syndromes&nbsp;(ano-rectal discharge,&nbsp;ulcers&nbsp;and&nbsp;vesicles),&nbsp;and&nbsp;genital&nbsp;warts. Scabies&nbsp;and&nbsp;pediculosis pubis may also be transmitted by sexual contact.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">In dealing with patients with STI, privacy and confidentiality, especially with the history taking and examination, are paramount.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">Education and counselling of STI patients and concurrent management&nbsp;of&nbsp;their&nbsp;partners&nbsp;provide additional&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;to&nbsp;reduce the risk of STI in the community.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#231F20;">(See section on 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Children' for STIs in children)</span></p>
