It is the commonest urological emergency in Ghana and worldwide. Adult males are more commonly affected. It is rare in children and in females. The causes differ in different age groups as well as in males and females. A family history of retention of urine in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer are risk factors.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><span ><strong>Retention of urine can be classified into three:</strong></span></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><span >Acute retention of Urine is of sudden onset with a palpable tender bladder.</span></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><span >Chronic Retention of Urine is of insidious onset and presents with a palpable non-tender bladder and overflow incontinence resulting in more damage to the bladder, ureters and kidneys. Post-renal renal failure may complicate this type of retention with hydronephroses and hydroureters.</span></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><span >Acute-on-chronic retention of urine is when a chronic retention of urine is suddenly complicated by acute retention of urine.</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;"><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Adult males - (above50 years): BPH, urethral strictures, bladder neck  stenosis</li><li>Adult males - (below 50 years/young males): urethral strictures, urethral injuries, bladder neck stenosis, neurogenic bladder/spinal injury, paraphimosis, urethral caculi, acute prostatitis</li><li>Male children - posterior urethral valves, meatal stenosis, phimosis, urethral calculi, congenital strictures</li><li>Adult females - retroverted gravid uterus, uterine fibroids/myomas, impacted ovarian cysts, neurogenic (postoperative and pelvic inflammatory disease), carcinoma of cervix with infiltration into the urethra</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">SYMPTOMS</h3><ul><li>Retention of urine in BPH precipitated by postponement of micturition, alcohol abuse and infection</li><li>Sudden inability to pass urine with painful bulge in lower abdomen for acute retention of urine</li><li>Gradual onset of inability to pass urine with painless bulge in lower abdomen for chronic retention of urine</li><li>History of urethritis, urethral instrumentation (e.g. catheterisation) or perineal injury, pelvic fracture or surgery in urethral strictures</li><li>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">SIGNS</h3><ul><li>Palpable tender bladder in acute retention of urine</li><li>Palpable non-tender bladder for chronic retention of urine</li><li>Uraemia/Azotaemia in renal failure</li><li>Fever in infections: UTI and prostatitis</li><li>Palpable kidneys in hydronephrosis</li><li>Haematuria in BPH, prostate cancer and urethral strictures</li></ul><h3 style="margin-left:0in;">REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3><p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Patients with hydronephroses on ultrasound scan and renal failure should be referred to specialist.</span></p><p> </p>
