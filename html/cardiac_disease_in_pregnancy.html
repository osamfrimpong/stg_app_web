<body><p><strong><u>CARDIAC DISEASE IN PREGNANCY</u></strong></p>
<p>Cardiac diseases are associated with high maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. They may be present before the pregnancy or develop during the pregnancy or puerperium (e.g. peripartum cardiomyopathy). Pregnancy places additional burden on the heart and makes pre-existing cardiac disease worse.</p>
<p>Some of the signs of pregnancy may mimic cardiac disease. Careful assessment of all patients must be undertaken to determine if they have cardiac disease or not.</p>
<p>Management requires a multi-disciplinary team including the obstetrician, neonatologist, anaesthetist and physician specialist or cardiologist. Patients with known cardiac disease must plan their pregnancies carefully in full consultation with their cardiologist and obstetrician. They must book early as soon as they become pregnant for antenatal care in hospital. All patients needing pharmacological treatment must be managed by a physician specialist or cardiologist and obstetrician.</p>

<li>Cough</li>
<li>Leg swelling</li>
</ul>
<h3>SIGNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cardiac murmurs</li>
<li>Other signs of cardiac disease depending on the type of lesion (See section on 'Disorders of the cardiovascular system')</li>
<li>Presence of heart failure (See section on 'Heart failure')</li>
</ul>
<h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>To maintain good cardiac function throughout the pregnancy, labour,</li>
</ul>
<p>delivery and puerperium</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent maternal and foetal complications</li>
<li>To prevent maternal death</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3>
<p>(See appropriate <strong>cardiac disease</strong>)</p>
<h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3>
<p>(See appropriate <strong>cardiac disease</strong>)</p>
<h3>REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3>
