<body><p>A goitre is a swelling of the front of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland. It may affect persons of any age. Not all neck swellings are goitres. Goitres are usually benign but may occasionally be malignant. They could be associated with  normal,  reduced or excessive  function of the thyroid gland. A reduction in production of thyroid hormones results in hypothyroidism while an excess results in hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Abnormalities of thyroid hormone production may also occur in the absence of goitre.</p><p>Proper diagnosis and selection of appropriate surgical or non-surgical treatment of benign and malignant goitres is by full clinical assessment and investigations. Treatment is not necessarily by increasing iodine intake e.g. in iodated salt. Excess iodine intake may actually be harmful in some cases.</p><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><ul><li>Simple non-toxic goitre or endemic goitre</li><li>Hypothyroidism (See section on '<a href="hypothyroidism.html">Hypothyroidism</a>')</li><li>Hyperthyroidism or Thyrotoxicosis (See section on '<a href="hyperthyroidism.html">Hyperthyroidism</a>')</li><li>Thyroid neoplasm - benign or malignant</li></ul><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Swelling in the neck</li><li>Breathing and swallowing difficulty, if large</li><li>Symptoms of hypothyroidism (See section on '<a href="hypothyroidism.html">Hypothyroidism</a>')</li><li>Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')</li></ul><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><ul><li>Diffuse (smooth) or nodular (irregular) thyroid swelling</li><li>Signs of hypothyroidism (See section on '<a href="hypothyroidism.html">Hypothyroidism</a>')</li><li>Signs of hyperthyroidism (See section on '<a href="hyperthyroidism.html">Hyperthyroidism</a>')</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Thyroid function tests - free T3, free T4, TSH</li><li>Thyroid ultrasound scan</li><li>Thyroid autoantibodies (if necessary)</li><li>Radioisotope scan of thyroid (if necessary)</li><li>Fine needle aspiration cytology (if necessary)</li><li>X-ray of the neck including thoracic inlet view for large goitres</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To assess and correct level of thyroid hormone production</li><li>To reduce symptoms associated with thyrotoxicosis</li><li>To reduce or prevent obstructive symptoms</li><li>To identify thyroid neoplasms and manage appropriately</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Subtotal thyroidectomy where indicated</li></ul><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Appropriate treatment of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (See sections on '<a href="hypothyroidism.html">Hypothyroidism</a>' and '<a href="hyperthyroidism.html">Hyperthyroidism</a>')</li></ul><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Refer patients to a physician or surgical specialist where complications (e.g. hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, breathing difficulty etc.) or malignancy are suspected or if full clinical assessment and investigations are not possible.</p>
