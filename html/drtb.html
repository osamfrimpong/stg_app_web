<p>Drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) must be presumed (suspected) in persons who remain bacteriologically positive (either smear positive, culture positive or Gene Xpert positive) after intensive phase of standard first-line TB treatment with or without clinical improvement. Persons who test rifampicin resistance positive at initial diagnosis with Gene Xpert must also be treated as cases of DR-TB. These persons must be further evaluated using TB culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) or newer molecular diagnostic tests such as Line Probe Assays (LPA).</p><p>Persons at high risk of drug resistance are TB patients failing Category I+III or Category II treatment, contacts of confirmed DR-TB patients and TB/HIV co-infected patients not improving on treatment.</p><p>Persons at medium risk of drug resistance are relapsed TB patients, return after lost-to-follow up and health care workers newly diagnosed with TB. Patients are classified according to the pattern of documented drug resistance profile.</p><p>The drug regimen for treatment is selected based on the following principles:</p><ul><li>History of drugs used to treat TB patients, profile of drug resistance in Ghana and/or DST profile of the patient</li><li>A minimum of four new core medicines that are known to be effective</li><li>Kanamycin/Capreomycin an injectable medicine, is the backbone of the four core medicines and should be used in the intensive phase</li><li>An effective fluoroquinolone should be used due to the extensive use of earlier generation fluoroquinolones</li><li>May include a first line drug to which the strain is susceptible.</li><li>Cross-resistance may occur between drugs of the same group and this is taken into consideration.</li><li>Drugs are administered daily under strict D0T throughout the injectable and continuation phases.</li></ul><p>Treatment of Multi Drug Resistant-TB (MDR-TB) and Rifampicin Resistant-TB (RR-TB) patients is prioritised. Treatment duration is 20-24 months and is determined by sputum smear and culture (bacteriological) conversion (Treatment lasts 16-18 months after bacteriological conversion). Progression from initial to continuation phase is dependent on at least four (4) consecutive months of negative sputum cultures.</p><p>Community-based care is promoted in Ghana over facility-based care except in situations requiring admission for management of complications. The practice of infection prevention and control should be maintained at all times during treatment of these patients.</p><p>Treatment adherence is critical in the treatment of DR-TB due to limited number of available, effective medicines. Treatment is challenging due to long duration, drug toxicities and side effects. Clinical teams must use a patient-centred care approach and support patients throughout treatment until cured. Psychosocial and economic support is required from treatment supporters, patient families and clinical teams throughout treatment. Early detection and prompt management of drug side effects ensures successful outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><div class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Note 18-5</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Treatment of Multi Drug Resistant-TB (MDR-TB) and Rifampicin Resistant-TB (RR-TB) patients is prioritised.
