Seventy-five percent of full term infants with undescended testes and 90% of premature infants would have spontaneous descent of testes from the intra-abdominal site by the age of on year. Persistent undescent of the testis is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, subfertility, atrophy of the testis and torsion.
