<p>Psychogenic seizures or pseudo seizures are non-epileptic seizures, which mimic epilepsy but actually have an underlying psychological cause. In patients with this form of disorder, there may be a history of physical, sexual or psychological abuse. The symptoms may be precipitated by stress and the signs are often variable and may include resistance to&nbsp; &nbsp;eye opening upon examination. The diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion since it is often difficult to separate from epileptic seizures and may, in fact co-exist with epilepsy.</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>Recurrent tonic clonic-like seizures</li><li>Attacks usually occur only when attention of other people can be attracted</li><li>Patients hardly ever get injured, even when they fall (unlike in true seizures)</li><li>Thrusting pelvic movements are common during "seizure" attacks</li><li>Tongue biting, if it occurs is usually at the tip of the tongue instead of the sides as in true seizures</li><li>May have urinary incontinence as in normal seizures</li></ul><p><strong>INVESTIGATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>Serum prolactin</li><li>EEG</li></ul><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><ul><li>To stop seizures</li><li>To restore normalcy</li></ul><p><strong>Non-pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Reassure parents, guardians etc.</li><li>Counselling</li><li>Psychotherapy</li></ul><p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Anti-epileptic medicines do not appear to have any beneficial effect on frequency of attacks&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>REFERRAL CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Refer all cases for evaluation by psychologist or psychiatrist.</p>
