<body><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Dizziness is a nonspecific term that refers  to abnormal sensation   of body orientation or position in space. These include feeling of unsteadiness, light-headedness and vertigo. Patients often find these sensations difficult to describe. Dizziness is almost always associated with other symptoms, therefore a careful history and focused physical examination should be performed in all cases to identify the cause.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Like dizziness, "blackouts" is a vague, descriptive term implying either altered consciousness, visual disturbance or a sensation of falling. A careful history, particularly from an eye-witness, is essential.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span >Episodes of transient disturbance of consciousness and falls are common clinical problems. It is usually possible to distinguish between  a fit (a seizure), an episode of fainting and other types of attack from the history given by the patient and the account of an eye witness.</span></p><h3>CAUSES</h3><p><strong>Cardiovascular</strong></p><p> • Vasovagal - (fainting)</p><p> • Postural hypotension</p><p> • Acute haemorrhage</p><p> • Cardiac arrhythmias</p><p> • Severe aortic stenosis</p><p> • Complete heart block with Stokes-Adams attacks</p><p> • Vertebro-basilar insufficiency</p><h3>Cerebral</h3><p> • Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA)</p><p> • Stroke</p><p> • Epilepsy</p><h3>Others</h3><p> • Drug-induced</p><p> • Severe anaemia</p><p> • Hypoglycaemia</p><p> • Middle ear disease</p><p> • Meniere's disease</p><p> • Conversion disorder (Hysterical fainting/Hyperventilation)</p><h3>SYMPTOMS</h3><p> • Light-headedness</p><p> • Loss of consciousness</p><p> • Sense of motion or spinning of body</p><p> • Unsteadiness</p><p> • Nausea</p><p> • Vomiting</p><p> • Tinnitus</p><h3>SIGNS</h3><p> • Sweating (suggests vasovagal episode/ hypoglycaemia)</p><p> • Tachycardia or bradycardia (suggest cardiac arrhythmia)</p><p> • Hypotension</p><p> • Postural hypotension</p><p> • Pallor</p><p>•      Nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesis, ataxia, hypotonia, dysarthria (suggests cerebellar cause)</p><p> • Focal neurological signs suggests stroke, TIA</p><h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3><p> • These vary depending on the cause</p><p> • FBC</p><p> • Random blood sugar</p><p> • X-ray of cervical spine</p><p> • ECG</p><h3>TREATMENT</h3><p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p><p> • To identify and appropriately manage the possible underlying cause(s)</p><h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3><p> • Postural hypotension - review medications</p><p> • Hyperventilation syndrome- breathing control exercise</p><p> • Counseling</p><p> • Cervical collar</p><p> • Moulded cervical pillows</p><h3>Pharmacological treatment</h3><p> • Treat the underlying cause.
