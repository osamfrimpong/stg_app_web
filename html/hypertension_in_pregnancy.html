<body><p><strong><u>HYPERTENSION IN PREGNANCY</u></strong></p>
<p>Hypertension in pregnancy denotes a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or higher on 2 occasions at least 5 minutes apart using an appropriate-sized cuff especially in obese patients. It is severe when systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher and diastolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg or higher. This includes women whose hypertension was diagnosed prior to pregnancy as well as during pregnancy. Known hypertensives on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and alpha-blockers should be switched to medications considered safe during pregnancy.</p>
<h3>CAUSES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy-induced hypertension (no proteinuria)</li>
<li>Pre-eclampsia (hypertension with proteinuria)</li>
<li>Eclampsia (hypertension with proteinuria and fits)</li>
<li>Chronic hypertension (existing before pregnancy)</li>
<li>Chronic hypertension with super-imposed pre-eclampsia or eclampsia</li>
</ul>
<p>(See sections on <strong>'Hypertension', 'Pre-eclampsia' and 'Eclampsia'</strong>)</p>
<h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>(See section on <strong>'Hypertension</strong>')</p>
<h3>SIGNS</h3>
<p>(See section on <strong>'Hypertension'</strong>)</p>
<h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC</li>
<li>Clotting profile</li>
<li>Serum Uric Acid</li>
<li>BUE and Creatinine</li>
<li>Urinalysis and culture</li>
<li>Liver function tests</li>
<li>Random blood glucose</li>
<li>Daily assessment of urine proteins (if patient on admission)</li>
<li>Repeated ultrasound scans for close foetal growth monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h3>TREATMENT</h3>
<p><strong>Treatment objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To control blood pressure</li>
<li>To detect or treat any complications that may arise especially super imposed pre-eclampsia</li>
<li>To prevent foetal complications</li>
<li>To deliver a healthy baby</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-pharmacological treatment</h3>
<p>(See section on <strong>'Antenatal Care' and on 'Hypertension')</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pharmacological treatment</strong></p>
<h3>A. Hypertension in Pregnancy not associated with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia</h3>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]</p>
<ul>
<li>Methyldopa, oral, 250-500 mg 8-12 hourly (max. 2g daily)</li>
</ul>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]</p>
<ul>
<li>Nifedipine sustained release, oral, 10-40 mg 12 hourly</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. Hypertension in Pregnancy associated with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia</h3>
<p>(See sections on <strong>'Hypertension', 'Pre-eclampsia' and 'Eclampsia'</strong>)</p>
<h3>REFERRAL CRITERIA</h3>
<p>Refer all cases of super-imposed pre-eclampsia or other obstetric complication promptly to a hospital or obstetrician after initiation of treatment.</p>
